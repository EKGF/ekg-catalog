# Use Case Tree Mindmap Diagram Rules

## Rules

1. Each use case page must display a mindmap diagram centered on the
   current use case.

2. The central node must show the current use case title with a link
   to its page. The central node is the only node that is boxed.

3. The left side must show only parent use case(s), if any exist. If a
   use case has multiple parents, all parents must be shown, with
   secondary parents connected with a dotted line. If a node does not
   have a parent, nothing must be shown on the left side.

4. The right side must show direct children and grandchildren of the
   current use case, but not great-grandchildren.

5. Children must be sorted alphabetically by title.
