# Countries

## Summary

Country reference data is fundamental geographic information used
across multiple use cases for risk assessment, compliance, and
geographic analysis. Country information includes risk
classifications, regulatory requirements, and relationships to regions
and jurisdictions.

This concept is used by:

- **Client 360 / Know Your Customer** - For customer geographic risk
  assessment, sanctions screening, and PEP identification
- **Legal Entity Management** - For entity geographic presence and
  compliance requirements

## The Challenge

Organizations face challenges in country reference data management:

  ratings for AML and sanctions purposes

  requirements across countries
- **Dynamic risk** — Country risk levels change over time based on
  political, economic, and security factors
- **Data consistency** — Ensuring consistent country data across
  systems and processes
- **Geographic relationships** — Understanding relationships between
  countries, regions, and jurisdictions
- **Sanctions implications** — Tracking which countries are subject to
  sanctions or embargoes

  handling country name variations
