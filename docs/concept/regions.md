# Regions

## Summary

Region reference data represents geographic regions, their risk
classifications, and relationships to countries and jurisdictions.
Regions may be defined by geography, economics, politics, or
regulatory frameworks. Understanding regions is important for risk
assessment, sanctions screening, and geographic analysis.

This concept is used by:

- **Client 360 / Know Your Customer** - For regional risk assessment
  and sanctions screening
- **Legal Entity Management** - For entity regional presence and
  compliance

## The Challenge

Organizations face challenges in region reference data management:

- **Definition complexity** — Regions can be defined in multiple ways
  (geographic, economic, political, regulatory)
- **Risk classification** — Determining and maintaining region risk
  ratings
- **Relationship mapping** — Understanding relationships between
  regions, countries, and jurisdictions
- **Dynamic changes** — Region risk levels and definitions change over
  time
- **Multi-regional operations** — Determining which regions apply to
  customers and entities with multi-regional operations
- **Data consistency** — Ensuring consistent region data across
  systems
- **Sanctions implications** — Tracking which regions are subject to
  sanctions or embargoes
- **Regulatory requirements** — Understanding region-specific
  regulatory requirements

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs provide powerful region reference data
management capabilities:

- **Hierarchical modeling** — Model relationships between regions,
  countries, and jurisdictions
- **Risk classification** — Connect regions to risk ratings and
  compliance requirements
- **Temporal tracking** — Track changes in region risk levels and
  definitions over time
- **Entity linking** — Connect customers and entities to regions for
  geographic risk assessment
- **Sanctions integration** — Link regions to sanctions regimes and
  embargoes
- **Multi-dimensional analysis** — Analyze risk based on regional
  relationships
- **Reference data management** — Maintain authoritative region
  reference data with relationships

## Business Value

- **Risk assessment** — Assess geographic risk based on regional
  relationships
- **Regulatory compliance** — Meet requirements for region-based risk
  assessment
- **Sanctions compliance** — Identify customers and entities in
  sanctioned regions for enhanced screening

  data
- **Operational efficiency** — Automate region-based risk assessment
  and screening
- **Strategic insights** — Understand regional distribution of
  customer and entity base
