# Jurisdictions

## Summary

Jurisdiction reference data represents legal and regulatory
jurisdictions, their requirements, and risk classifications.
Jurisdictions may be countries, states, provinces, or other legal
entities that have distinct regulatory frameworks. Understanding
jurisdictions is critical for compliance, risk assessment, and
determining appropriate due diligence measures.

This concept is used by:

- **Client 360 / Know Your Customer** - For compliance with
  jurisdiction-specific KYC and AML requirements
- **Legal Entity Management** - For entity registration and regulatory
  compliance across jurisdictions

## The Challenge

Organizations face challenges in jurisdiction reference data
management:

- **Complexity** — Jurisdictions can be countries, states, provinces,
  or other legal entities with overlapping boundaries
- **Regulatory requirements** — Different jurisdictions have different
  KYC, AML, and data privacy requirements
- **Risk classification** — Determining and maintaining jurisdiction
  risk ratings
- **Dynamic changes** — Jurisdictional requirements and risk levels
  change over time
- **Relationship mapping** — Understanding relationships between
  jurisdictions, countries, and regions
- **Multi-jurisdictional operations** — Determining which
  jurisdictions apply to customers and entities with
  multi-jurisdictional operations
- **Data consistency** — Ensuring consistent jurisdiction data across
  systems
- **Compliance complexity** — Managing compliance with multiple
  overlapping jurisdictions
