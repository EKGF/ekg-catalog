# Shared Concepts

This section contains shared reference data and concepts that are used
across multiple use cases. These concepts represent fundamental
building blocks that multiple use cases depend on.

## Geographic Reference Data

- [Countries](countries.md) - Country reference data for geographic
  risk assessment
- [Jurisdictions](jurisdictions.md) - Legal and regulatory
  jurisdictions
- [Regions](regions.md) - Geographic regions for risk classification

These reference data concepts are used by:

- [Client 360 / Know Your Customer](../use-case/client-360/index.md) -
  For customer geographic risk assessment
- [Legal Entity Management](../use-case/legal-entity-management/index.md) -
  For entity geographic presence and compliance
