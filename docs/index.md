# Introduction

Welcome to the use case catalog for the Enterprise Knowledge Graph.

This Catalog is a collection of all use cases that are being worked on
are being discussed in the [EKGF](https://ekgf.org) community.

Besides all use cases, we have:

- [Use Cases](use-case/index.md), comprehensive use case catalog
- [Datasets](dataset/index.md), per use case
- [Ontologies](ontology/index.md), per dataset and per use case

Reference data and shared concepts are now organized within use cases,
particularly in the
[Core Record Management](use-case/core-record-management/index.md) use
case.
