# EKG/IRI

An EKG/IRI is an Enterprise Knowledge Graph Identifier that has the form of a URL/URI[^1]



[^1]: We prefer to use the term IRI because a) that's the most recent name of the URI standard and b) IRIs support international encodings so that terms
in non-latin languages like Chinese and Arab can also be supported.
