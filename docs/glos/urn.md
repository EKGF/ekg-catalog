# URN --- Uniform Resource Name

An IETF standard: [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8141](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8141).

A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is special type of URI (or IRI) just
like a URL is a special type of URI or IRI.

A URN is not a URL though. Where a URL is "location dependent" because
it has the host and domain name of the machine that serves a given
resource built into the URL, a URN is "location independent", it
is "just" an identifier, not also a "locator".

A URN could look like this for example:

| URN                                          | Corresponds to                                                                           |
