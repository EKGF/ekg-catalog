!!! note "Fun fact"

    [Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazegraph)

    > It was alleged that Amazon Neptune is based on 
    > [Blazegraph](blazegraph.md), as evidenced by:
    >
    > - acquiring of the Blazegraph trademark by AWS;
    > - acquiring of the blazegraph.com domain name by AWS;
    > - transition of many employees (including CEO) to AWS.

    However, currently, Neptune and Blazegraph are completely 
    different products.
