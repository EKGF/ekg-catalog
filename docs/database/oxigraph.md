# Oxigraph

## What is OxiGraph?

From the Oxigraph website:

> [Oxigraph](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph) is a graph database 
> implementing the SPARQL standard.
> 
> Its goal is to provide a compliant, safe, and fast graph database based
> on the [RocksDB key-value store](http://rocksdb.org/)[^1]. It is written in Rust. 
> It also provides a set of utility functions for reading, writing,
> and processing RDF files.
> 
> Oxigraph is in heavy development and SPARQL query evaluation has not been optimized yet.
