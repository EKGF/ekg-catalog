## What is BlazeGraph?

Amazon semi-acquired Blazegraph a number of years ago, most key people
are now working in the [Amazon Neptune](neptune.md) team. However,
since then, Blazegraph still exists as an open source project on
[GitHub](https://github.com/blazegraph/database) with an active community 
of users.

As an Open Source database, it is still a very interesting product.

From the [Blazegraph Website](https://blazegraph.com/):
