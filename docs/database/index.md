# Databases / Triplestores

Since [SPARQL 1.1](../glos/sparql.md) is a W3C standard and most triplestore products are fully compliant with that standard we can
potentially run this LUBM benchmark against any database that supports the SPARQL 1.1 query language.

However, we think that LUBM is particularly useful for comparing the following major triplestores, each of which
serves its own market and has its own unique selling points but all support SPARQL 1.1 as their primary query language:
