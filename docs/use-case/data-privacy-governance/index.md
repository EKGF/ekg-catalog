# Data Privacy & Governance

## Summary

Data privacy and governance requires tracking and managing personal data
across all systems, ensuring compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other
privacy regulations. This involves understanding data lineage, consent,
sharing agreements, and cross-system relationships.

Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG) technology provides the semantic
foundation to model and query these relationships automatically,
enabling automated compliance reporting and privacy management.

## The Challenge

Privacy regulations require organizations to:

- Track personal data across all systems and applications
- Understand data lineage from collection to deletion
- Manage consent and sharing agreements
- Identify and respond to data subject requests
- Demonstrate compliance through automated reporting
- Monitor cross-system data flows and relationships

Traditional approaches cannot efficiently model or query these
complex relationships across siloed systems.

## Why EKG is Required

Privacy regulations require understanding data lineage, consent,
sharing agreements, and cross-system relationships. EKG provides:

- **Semantic data modeling** — Ontologies enable precise modeling of
  personal data, consent, and privacy relationships
- **Automatic lineage tracking** — Graph structure enables automatic
  discovery and tracking of data flows
- **Cross-system visibility** — Semantic relationships enable queries
  across all systems, not just isolated views
- **Automated compliance** — Graph queries enable automated generation
  of compliance reports and responses to data subject requests
- **Relationship discovery** — Graph algorithms can discover unexpected
  data relationships and privacy risks

## Business Value

- **Reduced regulatory fines** — Automated compliance reduces risk of
  violations
- **Improved customer trust** — Transparent privacy management builds
  trust
- **Automated compliance reporting** — Reduces manual effort and
  improves accuracy
- **Faster response to data subject requests** — Automated queries
  enable rapid responses
- **Proactive risk management** — Early identification of privacy risks
