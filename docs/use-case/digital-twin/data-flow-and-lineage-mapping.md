Knowing where data originates, where it moves, and how it is
transformed is essential for both business control and risk
management.

## Outcomes

- Faster breach and incident impact assessment (what data was exposed)
- Stronger compliance reporting and defensibility (scope and lineage)
- Better prioritization of protective controls for sensitive flows
- Reduced operational overhead in answering “where is this data used?”
  questions

## Typical scope

- Data sources, transformations, and destinations (systems and
  processes)
- Sensitive data handling requirements linked to flows
- Evidence for audits and regulatory reporting
- Change impact analysis for data pipeline modifications

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can help answer lineage questions, draft impact statements, and
compile evidence for audits—guardrailed by authoritative lineage
sources, privacy constraints, and human approval for external
reporting.
