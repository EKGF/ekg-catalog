Dependencies define business risk: when a component fails or is
compromised, the impact spreads through relationships.

## Outcomes

- Faster, more accurate change impact analysis
- Reduced outage and incident impact through clearer blast radius
  awareness
- Better prioritization of resilience investments for critical
  dependency chains
- Improved supplier concentration risk visibility

## Typical scope

- Service-to-service and system-to-system dependencies
- Data dependencies and integration pathways
- Third-party and SaaS dependency mapping
- Critical path identification and risk scoring inputs

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can draft impact summaries (“what breaks if X changes”),
identify missing relationships, and propose dependency
hypotheses—guardrailed by authoritative data sources and human
validation for decisions.
