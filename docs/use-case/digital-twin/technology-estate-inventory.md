An authoritative inventory helps answer basic but high-impact
questions: What do we run? Who owns it? How critical is it? What
depends on it?

## Outcomes

- Reduced “unknown asset” risk and clearer accountability
- Faster impact analysis for change, outages, and incidents
- Better prioritization of investment, remediation, and modernization
- Improved compliance reporting through clearer scope and ownership

## Typical scope

- Systems, applications, platforms, and infrastructure components
- Ownership, support model, and lifecycle status
- Service criticality and recovery expectations
- Key third-party dependencies (SaaS, managed services)

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can help reconcile inventory sources, identify inconsistencies,
propose owners for orphan assets, and draft stakeholder
updates—guardrailed by authoritative sources and human confirmation
before ownership changes.
