  Digital Twin of Technology and Data Landscape
summary: >-
  Digital twin of technology and data landscape creates a comprehensive digital representation of an organization's complete technology estate including systems, applications, infrastructure, data flows, dependencies, business processes, security, compliance, costs, and performance. This use case addresses lack of visibility into the technology estate, understanding dependencies between systems, impact analysis for changes and migrations, optimizing technology costs and performance, risk assessment and compliance monitoring, and enabling strategic planning through comprehensive understanding built from reusable, composable components.

Digital Twin of the technology and data landscape provides a shared,
decision-ready view of what exists, how it connects, and what business
impact those connections create. It supports strategic planning, risk
decisions, and day-to-day execution (changes, incidents, audits) with
consistent context.

## Outcomes

- Clear ownership and criticality for systems and services
- Faster and more reliable impact analysis for changes and incidents
- Reduced technology cost through rationalization and optimization
  decisions
- Improved risk and compliance visibility with traceable evidence
- Better prioritization of modernization and resilience investments

## Components

- [Technology Estate Inventory](technology-estate-inventory.md)
- [Dependency & Relationship Mapping](dependency-and-relationship-mapping.md)
- [Data Flow & Lineage Mapping](data-flow-and-lineage-mapping.md)
- [Security & Compliance Posture Visibility](security-and-compliance-posture-visibility.md)

## Typical uses

- Change and migration planning (blast radius, sequencing, risk)
- Incident response support (scope, dependencies, affected services)
- Audit preparation and compliance reporting (scope, evidence,
  ownership)
- Cost optimization and decommissioning decisions (redundancy,
  underuse)
- Strategic planning (target architectures and transition roadmaps)

## GenAI-enabled execution

GenAI can turn the digital twin into an execution surface by
delegating tasks to autonomous specialist agents (e.g.,
impact-analysis agent, inventory reconciler, evidence compiler,
executive brief drafter). These agents must be guardrailed by approved
scope, explicit approvals for high-impact actions, and traceable
provenance of every claim. An EKG can provide the authoritative
context (assets, owners, dependencies, policies, controls) that keeps
agent outputs relevant and auditable.
