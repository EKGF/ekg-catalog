  Digital Twin of Technology and Data Landscape
summary: >-
  Digital twin of technology and data landscape creates a comprehensive digital representation of an organization's complete technology estate including systems, applications, infrastructure, data flows, dependencies, business processes, security, compliance, costs, and performance. This use case addresses lack of visibility into the technology estate, understanding dependencies between systems, impact analysis for changes and migrations, optimizing technology costs and performance, risk assessment and compliance monitoring, and enabling strategic planning through comprehensive understanding built from reusable, composable components.

## The Challenge

Organizations struggle with:

- Lack of visibility into the complete technology estate
- Understanding dependencies between systems and applications
- Impact analysis for changes and migrations
- Optimizing technology costs and performance
- Risk assessment and compliance monitoring
- Strategic planning without comprehensive understanding

Traditional approaches cannot effectively model the complex,
multi-dimensional relationships between systems, applications, data
flows, business processes, and dependencies.

## Why EKG is Required

Traditional approaches cannot effectively model the complex,
multi-dimensional relationships between systems, applications, data
flows, business processes, and dependencies. EKG's composable
component architecture enables:

- **Comprehensive modeling** — Reusable components represent all
  aspects: systems, applications, infrastructure, data flows,
  dependencies, business processes, security, compliance, costs, and
  performance
- **Relationship representation** — Graph structure naturally
  represents complex relationships and dependencies
- **Real-time queries** — Graph queries enable real-time visibility
  and analysis
- **Incremental building** — Components can be added incrementally as
  the landscape is discovered
- **Composable architecture** — Reusable components enable rapid
  adaptation as the landscape evolves

Organizations can build a digital twin by composing reusable
components that represent:

- All systems, applications, and infrastructure
- Data flows, dependencies, and relationships
- Business processes and their technology dependencies
- Security and compliance postures
- Cost and performance metrics

## Capabilities Enabled

This digital twin enables:

- **Real-time visibility** — Complete view of the entire technology
  estate
- **Impact analysis** — Understand the impact of changes and
  migrations before execution
- **Optimization opportunities** — Identify cost and performance
  optimization opportunities across the landscape
- **Risk assessment** — Identify risks and compliance gaps
- **Strategic planning** — Informed decision-making based on
  comprehensive understanding

## Business Value

- **Reduced technology costs** — Optimization opportunities identified
  and executed
- **Improved risk management** — Proactive identification and
  mitigation of risks
- **Faster change impact analysis** — Understand impacts before making
  changes
- **Better strategic planning** — Informed decisions based on
  comprehensive understanding
- **Optimized resource allocation** — Better understanding enables
  optimal resource allocation

The ability to build such comprehensive capabilities from reusable,
tested components is unique to EKG when following the Use Case Tree
Method completely.
