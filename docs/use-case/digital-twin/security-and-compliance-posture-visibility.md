This use case connects posture signals (controls, exceptions,
findings) to the services and business outcomes they affect, turning
fragmented status reports into decision-ready insight.

## Outcomes

- Clear, business-relevant view of posture for critical services
- Better prioritization of remediation and investment
- Stronger audit readiness through traceable evidence
- Reduced surprises by surfacing material changes early

## Typical scope

- Posture signals from key control domains (identity, configuration,
  data)
- Findings and exception tracking with clear ownership
- Reporting by service criticality, business unit, or regulatory scope
- Trend analysis and progress reporting

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can draft executive summaries, highlight posture regressions,
and assemble evidence narratives—guardrailed by authoritative sources
and human sign-off before external use.
