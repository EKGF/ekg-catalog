## The Challenge

Financial institutions face challenges in address management:

- **Address format diversity** — Different countries use different
  address formats and conventions
- **Data quality** — Addresses may be incomplete, inaccurate, or use
  inconsistent formatting
- **Address changes** — Customers move frequently, requiring ongoing
  address validation and updates
- **Multiple addresses** — Customers may have residential, business,
  mailing, and registered addresses
- **Geographic risk** — Addresses in high-risk jurisdictions require
  enhanced due diligence
- **Validation complexity** — Verifying address authenticity across
  different countries and jurisdictions
- **Privacy regulations** — Managing address data in compliance with
  GDPR and other privacy regulations
- **Data integration** — Address data is scattered across multiple
  systems and must be unified

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs provide powerful address management
capabilities:

- **Unified address view** — Connect all customer addresses across
  systems and time periods
- **Address relationships** — Link addresses to identify shared
  residences, business locations, and address networks
- **Geographic context** — Connect addresses to jurisdictions,
  regions, and countries for risk assessment
- **Temporal tracking** — Track address changes over time and maintain
  historical address records
- **Validation integration** — Connect to address validation services
  and maintain validation results
- **Risk analysis** — Use address data for geographic risk assessment
  and sanctions screening
- **Data quality improvement** — Identify and resolve address
  inconsistencies and duplicates

## Business Value

- **Identity verification** — Use addresses as part of customer
  identification and verification
- **Risk assessment** — Assess geographic risk based on customer
  addresses
- **Regulatory compliance** — Meet requirements for address collection
  and validation
- **Data quality** — Improve address data quality through validation
  and deduplication
- **Operational efficiency** — Automate address validation and reduce
  manual data entry
- **Customer experience** — Ensure accurate address data for
  communications and service delivery
