## The Challenge

Financial institutions face challenges in building management:

  business relationships to properties

- **Data quality** — Maintaining accurate and up-to-date building
  information
- **Multiple relationships** — Customers may have multiple building
  relationships (owner, tenant, business location)
- **Change tracking** — Tracking changes in building ownership,
  occupancy, and use over time
- **Integration** — Connecting building data with address, location,
  and customer records
