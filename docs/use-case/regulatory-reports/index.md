  Enterprise-Spanning Regulatory Reports
summary: >-
  Enterprise-spanning regulatory reports generate compliance reports across multiple jurisdictions by automatically tracing data lineage, providing complete provenance for every data point, and enabling rapid adaptation to changing regulations through composable components. This use case addresses complete data lineage tracking across siloed systems, automated report generation with audit trails, cross-system data aggregation and validation, compliance with multiple regulatory requirements, and the ability to respond quickly to new regulations by recomposing existing components.

## The Challenge

Regulatory reporting requires:

- Complete data lineage tracking across all systems
- Full provenance for every data point in reports
- Compliance with multiple regulatory requirements across
  jurisdictions
- Rapid adaptation to changing regulations
- Automated report generation with audit trails
- Cross-system data aggregation and validation

Traditional approaches require massive manual effort, are error-prone,
and cannot adapt quickly to regulatory changes.

## Why EKG is Required

Traditional approaches cannot efficiently trace data lineage across
siloed systems or provide complete provenance for every data point.
EKG's composable component architecture enables:

- **Automatic lineage discovery** — Graph structure enables automatic
  discovery and tracking of data flows across systems
- **Complete provenance** — Every data point can be traced to its
  source with full context
- **Composable reporting** — Reusable components enable rapid
  adaptation to new regulatory requirements
- **Cross-system aggregation** — Semantic relationships enable
  automatic aggregation across siloed systems
- **Automated validation** — Graph queries can validate data
  consistency and completeness
- **Audit trails** — Complete lineage provides built-in audit
  capabilities

With fully discovered lineage and provenance, organizations can:

- Automatically trace data lineage across all systems
- Provide complete provenance for every data point
- Comply with regulatory requirements across multiple jurisdictions
- Adapt to changing regulations by recomposing existing components
- Deliver reports that would be impossible or prohibitively expensive
  with traditional approaches

## Business Value

- **Reduced compliance risk** — Automated, accurate reporting reduces
  risk of violations
- **Faster regulatory reporting** — Automated generation reduces time
  to produce reports
- **Automated lineage tracking** — Reduces manual effort and improves
  accuracy
- **Reduced manual effort** — Automation frees up resources for
  analysis
- **Ability to respond to new regulations quickly** — Composable
  components enable rapid adaptation

This use case particularly demonstrates the power of composable
components—regulatory reporting capabilities can be built
incrementally from reusable components, enabling rapid adaptation to
changing regulatory requirements.
