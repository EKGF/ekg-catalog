  Supply Chain Management
summary: >-
  Supply chain management addresses the complexity of multi-tier supplier networks spanning multiple geographies, product dependencies, logistics routes, and regulatory jurisdictions. This use case enables real-time visibility across the entire supply network, dynamic optimization in response to disruptions, complete provenance tracking from raw materials to finished products, and proactive risk assessment to identify single points of failure and dependency risks.

## The Challenge

Modern supply chains are incredibly complex, involving:

- Multiple tiers of suppliers across different geographies
- Complex product relationships and dependencies
- Logistics networks spanning multiple carriers and routes
- Demand forecasting across different markets and channels
- Regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions
- Risk management for disruptions and dependencies

Traditional approaches cannot effectively model or query these
complex, multi-dimensional relationships in real-time.

## Why EKG is Required

Supply chains involve complex, multi-level relationships that span
organizations, geographies, and time. EKG enables:

- **Real-time relationship modeling** — Graph structure naturally
  represents supplier relationships, product dependencies, and
  logistics networks
- **Cross-organizational visibility** — Semantic relationships enable
  queries across the entire supply network, not just isolated systems
- **Dynamic optimization** — Real-time queries enable rapid response
  to disruptions and optimization opportunities
- **Provenance and traceability** — Complete lineage tracking from raw
  materials to finished products
- **Risk assessment** — Graph queries can identify single points of
  failure and dependency risks across the network

## Business Value

- **Reduced costs** — Optimized logistics and inventory management
- **Improved resilience** — Better visibility enables proactive risk
  management
- **Faster response to disruptions** — Real-time visibility enables
  rapid adaptation
- **Better supplier relationships** — Comprehensive view enables
  better collaboration
- **Regulatory compliance** — Complete traceability supports
  compliance requirements
