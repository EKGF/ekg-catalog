## The Challenge

Organizations face significant challenges in vendor offboarding:

- **Offboarding complexity** — Offboarding involves multiple steps
  across different systems and departments
- **Contract termination** — Properly terminating vendor contracts and
  ensuring all obligations are met
- **System access removal** — Removing vendor access from all systems
  and ensuring security
- **Data archival** — Archiving vendor data while maintaining
  accessibility for historical reference
- **Final assessment** — Conducting final performance assessment and
  capturing lessons learned
- **Compliance** — Ensuring compliance requirements are met during
  offboarding
- **Coordination** — Coordinating offboarding across multiple
  departments and systems
- **Data fragmentation** — Vendor offboarding information scattered
  across multiple systems

Traditional vendor offboarding processes are manual, time-consuming,
and lack the integrated view needed for efficient and comprehensive
vendor offboarding.

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs provide powerful vendor offboarding
capabilities:

- **Unified offboarding view** — Connect all vendor offboarding
  information across systems
- **Workflow automation** — Use graph relationships to automate
  offboarding workflows
- **System integration** — Integrate offboarding across multiple
  systems using semantic relationships
- **Data archival** — Archive vendor data while maintaining
  relationships for historical reference
- **Compliance tracking** — Track compliance requirements during
  offboarding through graph relationships
- **Historical preservation** — Preserve vendor historical records
  through graph temporal relationships
- **Lessons learned** — Capture and analyze offboarding lessons
  learned using graph relationships

## Business Value

- **Operational efficiency** — Automated offboarding processes reduce
  manual effort and offboarding time
- **Compliance assurance** — Better compliance tracking ensures
  regulatory compliance
- **Security** — Proper system access removal ensures security
- **Historical reference** — Preserved vendor historical records
  enable future reference and analysis
- **Risk management** — Proper offboarding maintains risk management
  standards
