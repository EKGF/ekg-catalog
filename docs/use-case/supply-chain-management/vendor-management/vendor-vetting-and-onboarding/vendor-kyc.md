## The Challenge

Organizations face significant challenges in vendor KYC:

- **Regulatory requirements** — Especially for regulated industries,
  vendor KYC must meet strict regulatory requirements similar to
  customer KYC
- **Identity verification** — Verifying vendor identity and legal
  entity structure across different jurisdictions
- **Beneficial ownership** — Identifying ultimate beneficial owners
  through complex ownership structures
- **Sanctions screening** — Screening vendors against sanctions lists
  and other restrictions
- **PEP checks** — Checking for politically exposed persons in vendor
  ownership or management
- **Risk assessment** — Assessing vendor risk based on multiple
  factors including geography, relationships, and compliance history
- **Data fragmentation** — Vendor KYC information scattered across
  multiple systems and sources
- **Regulatory changes** — Keeping up with changing regulatory
  requirements across jurisdictions

Traditional vendor KYC processes are manual, time-consuming, and lack
the integrated view needed for comprehensive vendor assessment,
especially when dealing with complex entity structures and regulatory
requirements.

  requirements through integrated data view

## Related Use Cases

- **[Know Your Customer (KYC)](../../../client-360/know-your-customer/index.md)** -
  Vendor KYC leverages KYC processes and data for identity
  verification, risk assessment, and compliance checks. For regulated
  industries like banks, vendor KYC requirements are similar to
  customer KYC requirements, especially when vendors provide
  consultancy or other services to regulated entities.

- **[Legal Entity Management](../../../legal-entity-management/index.md)** -
  Vendor KYC depends heavily on Legal Entity Management for
  comprehensive information about vendor entity structures, ownership,
  relationships, and compliance. This is essential for proper vendor
  identity verification and risk assessment.
