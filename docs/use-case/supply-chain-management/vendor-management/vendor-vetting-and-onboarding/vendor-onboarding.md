## The Challenge

Organizations face significant challenges in vendor onboarding:

- **Onboarding complexity** — Onboarding involves multiple steps
  across different systems and departments
- **Compliance documentation** — Ensuring all compliance documentation
  is collected and verified
- **Contract setup** — Setting up vendor contracts and terms
- **System access** — Provisioning appropriate system access for
  vendors
- **Data quality** — Ensuring vendor data is accurate and complete
  across all systems
- **Onboarding speed** — Balancing thorough onboarding with speed to
  enable vendor engagement
- **Coordination** — Coordinating onboarding across multiple
  departments and systems
- **Data fragmentation** — Vendor onboarding information scattered
  across multiple systems

Traditional vendor onboarding processes are manual, time-consuming,
and lack the integrated view needed for efficient and comprehensive
vendor onboarding.

  systems through semantic relationships
- **Compliance tracking** — Track compliance documentation and
  requirements through graph relationships
- **System integration** — Integrate onboarding across multiple
  systems using semantic relationships
- **Onboarding analytics** — Analyze onboarding processes and identify
  bottlenecks using graph queries
- **Relationship establishment** — Establish vendor relationships with
  accounts, contracts, and other entities through graph structure

## Business Value

- **Operational efficiency** — Automated onboarding processes reduce
  manual effort and onboarding time
- **Compliance assurance** — Better compliance tracking ensures
  regulatory compliance

  data quality
