## The Challenge

Organizations face significant challenges in vendor vetting and
onboarding:

- **Regulatory requirements** — Especially for regulated industries,
  vendor vetting must meet strict regulatory requirements similar to
  customer KYC
- **Identity verification** — Verifying vendor identity and legal
  entity structure
- **Due diligence** — Comprehensive due diligence including financial,
  operational, and compliance checks
- **Risk assessment** — Assessing vendor risk including financial,
  operational, compliance, and reputational risks
- **Legal entity complexity** — Understanding complex vendor entity
  structures, ownership, and relationships
- **Compliance checks** — Checking vendor compliance with regulations,
  sanctions, and other requirements
- **Onboarding efficiency** — Balancing thorough vetting with
  onboarding speed
- **Data fragmentation** — Vendor vetting information scattered across
  multiple systems and sources

Traditional vendor vetting processes are manual, time-consuming, and
lack the integrated view needed for comprehensive vendor assessment,
especially when dealing with complex entity structures and regulatory
requirements.

## Why EKG is Required

capabilities:

- **Integrated data view** — Connect vendor vetting data with legal
  entity, financial, compliance, and risk information
- **KYC integration** — Leverage KYC processes and data for vendor
  vetting, especially for regulated industries
- **Legal entity analysis** — Analyze vendor legal entity structures,
  ownership, and relationships for comprehensive understanding
- **Risk assessment** — Integrate multiple risk factors for
  comprehensive vendor risk assessment
- **Compliance checking** — Automate compliance checks using graph
  queries across multiple data sources
- **Relationship analysis** — Understand vendor relationships and
  networks that may affect risk
- **Automated workflows** — Use graph relationships to automate vendor
  vetting workflows

## Business Value

- **Risk mitigation** — Comprehensive vendor vetting reduces supply
  chain risks
- **Regulatory compliance** — Especially for regulated industries,
  proper vendor vetting ensures compliance with regulatory
  requirements
- **Quality assurance** — Better vendor vetting ensures vendor quality
  and capability
- **Cost reduction** — Avoiding high-risk vendors reduces potential
  costs and disruptions
- **Operational efficiency** — Automated vetting processes reduce
  manual effort and onboarding time

## Components

## Related Use Cases

- **[Know Your Customer (KYC)](../../../client-360/know-your-customer/index.md)** -
  Vendor vetting leverages KYC processes and data for identity
  verification, risk assessment, and compliance checks, especially for
  regulated industries like banks. Vendor KYC requirements are similar
  to customer KYC requirements.

- **[Legal Entity Management](../../../legal-entity-management/index.md)** -
  Vendor vetting depends heavily on Legal Entity Management for
  comprehensive information about vendor entity structures, ownership,
  relationships, financial information, and compliance. This is
  essential for proper vendor assessment and risk evaluation.
