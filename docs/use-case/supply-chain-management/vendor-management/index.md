  Vendor management encompasses the end-to-end processes for selecting, onboarding, managing relationships with, and offboarding suppliers. This use case addresses the complexity of understanding vendor legal entity structures, managing multi-contract relationships, monitoring performance, assessing risks, and ensuring regulatory compliance, particularly for organizations in regulated industries where vendor vetting requirements mirror customer KYC standards.

## The Challenge

Organizations face significant challenges in vendor management:

- **Vendor vetting complexity** — Especially for regulated industries,
  vendor vetting requires comprehensive identity verification, risk
  assessment, and compliance checks similar to customer KYC
- **Legal entity understanding** — Vendors are legal entities
  requiring comprehensive understanding of entity structures,
  ownership, and relationships
- **Relationship management** — Managing vendor relationships across
  multiple contracts, projects, and business units
- **Performance monitoring** — Tracking vendor performance across
  multiple dimensions
- **Contract management** — Managing vendor contracts, terms, and
  compliance
- **Risk assessment** — Assessing vendor risk including financial,
  operational, and compliance risks
- **Data fragmentation** — Vendor information scattered across
  procurement, legal, compliance, and other systems
- **Vendor networks** — Understanding vendor networks and
  relationships, including subcontractors and affiliates

Traditional vendor management systems operate in silos and lack the
integrated view needed for comprehensive vendor understanding,
especially when dealing with complex entity structures and regulatory
requirements.

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs provide powerful vendor management
capabilities:

- **Unified vendor view** — Connect all vendor information across
  systems and time periods
- **Legal entity integration** — Seamlessly integrate with Legal
  Entity Management for comprehensive vendor entity information
- **KYC integration** — Leverage KYC processes and data for vendor
  vetting, especially for regulated industries
- **Relationship analysis** — Understand vendor relationships,
  networks, and affiliations through graph analysis
- **Risk assessment** — Assess vendor risk through integrated view of
  entity, financial, and compliance information
- **Performance tracking** — Track vendor performance across multiple
  dimensions using graph queries
- **Network analysis** — Understand vendor networks and identify
  dependencies and risks
- **Cross-system queries** — Query across procurement, legal entity,
  compliance, and other systems for comprehensive vendor understanding

## Business Value

- **Risk mitigation** — Comprehensive vendor vetting and risk
  assessment reduces supply chain risks
- **Regulatory compliance** — Especially for regulated industries,
  proper vendor vetting ensures compliance with regulatory
  requirements
- **Supply chain optimization** — Better vendor understanding enables
  supply chain optimization
- **Cost reduction** — Better vendor management leads to cost
  optimization and reduced risks
- **Performance improvement** — Better vendor performance tracking
  enables performance improvement
- **Operational efficiency** — Automated vendor management processes
  reduce manual effort

## Components

## Related Use Cases

Vendor Management depends on and integrates with several other use
cases:

- **[Know Your Customer (KYC)](../../client-360/know-your-customer/index.md)** -
  Vendor vetting processes overlap significantly with customer KYC,
  especially for regulated industries like banks. Vendor KYC requires
  similar identity verification, risk assessment, and compliance
  checks as customer KYC.

- **[Legal Entity Management](../../legal-entity-management/index.md)** -
  Vendors are legal entities requiring comprehensive understanding of
  entity structures, ownership, relationships, financial information,
  and compliance. Legal Entity Management provides essential
  information for vendor management.

- **[Customer Relationship Management (CRM)](../../client-360/customer-relationship-management/index.md)** -
  Vendor relationships share patterns with customer relationships. CRM
  relationship management approaches can be leveraged for managing
  vendor relationships, and understanding vendor networks can inform
  customer relationship strategies.

### Shared Concepts

Vendor Management uses these shared reference data concepts:

- **[Countries](../../../concept/countries.md)** - Geographic
  reference data for vendor location and risk assessment
- **[Jurisdictions](../../../concept/jurisdictions.md)** - Legal and
  regulatory jurisdictions for vendor compliance
- **[Regions](../../../concept/regions.md)** - Geographic regions for
  vendor risk classification

These shared concepts are also used by Legal Entity Management, Know
Your Customer, Customer Relationship Management, and other use cases.
