Cyber risk management helps the business decide where to invest, which
risks to accept, and how to balance security controls with operational
realities.

## Outcomes

- Risk decisions aligned to business priorities and critical services
- Transparent risk ownership, acceptance, and treatment plans
- Improved prioritization of remediation and control investments
- Better executive reporting and regulatory defensibility

## Typical scope

- A cyber risk register with clear ownership and status
- Scenario-based risk analysis (e.g., ransomware, data exfiltration)
- Risk appetite and thresholds (what requires escalation)
- Treatment planning (reduce, avoid, transfer, accept)
