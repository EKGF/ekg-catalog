Compliance work becomes high-friction when evidence is scattered and
control ownership is unclear. This use case focuses on making
compliance repeatable and scalable.

## Outcomes

- Faster audits with fewer disruptions to delivery teams
- Higher confidence in control coverage and effectiveness
- Reduced compliance risk through earlier issue detection
- Clear traceability from obligations → controls → evidence

## Typical scope

- Obligation and control mapping (e.g., ISO, SOC2, NIS2, sector
  regulations)
- Evidence collection, validation, and retention
- Control testing and issue management
- Reporting for executives, auditors, and regulators

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can assemble evidence packs, draft narratives, and identify
gaps by cross-referencing obligations and available
artifacts—guardrailed by authoritative sources, privacy constraints,
and human sign-off.
