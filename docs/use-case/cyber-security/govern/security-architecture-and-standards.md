Security architecture and standards help the business scale security
by making secure-by-default design the easiest path for delivery
teams.

## Outcomes

- Faster delivery through pre-approved security patterns
- Reduced architectural risk and fewer late-stage security surprises
- Consistent controls across services and environments
- Clear exception handling with compensating controls

## Typical scope

- Reference architectures (cloud, SaaS integration, OT/ICS where
  relevant)
- Security patterns (identity, secrets, encryption, segmentation)
- Technology standards and approved products/services
- Architectural review and exception management

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can draft architecture review summaries and compare proposed
designs to approved patterns, highlighting gaps and required
approvals—guardrailed by explicit standards, decision records, and
human sign-off.
