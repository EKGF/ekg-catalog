Security strategy and policy translate risk appetite and obligations
into practical guidance: what must be protected, what “good” looks
like, and how exceptions are handled.

## Outcomes

- Shared understanding of security priorities and decision criteria
- Consistent policies and standards across products and teams
- Reduced friction from unclear or conflicting guidance
- Faster approvals through well-defined exception pathways
- Stronger defensibility during audits and after incidents

## Typical scope

- Security principles (e.g., least privilege, defense-in-depth)
- Policy library and standards (baseline requirements)
- Exception process (risk acceptance, compensating controls)
- Metrics and reporting (policy adoption, exception volume, residual
  risk)

## GenAI-enabled execution

Specialised agents can help keep policies current by summarizing
changes in regulations and internal standards, drafting updates, and
mapping policy text to controls—guardrailed by human approval and
traceable sources.
