Many critical services depend on third parties (SaaS, managed
services, software suppliers). This use case ensures the business
understands and manages that dependency risk.

## Outcomes

- Reduced risk from vendor breaches and insecure integrations
- Clear security requirements in procurement and contracts
- Faster impact assessment when a supplier issue emerges
- Better continuity planning for critical third-party dependencies

## Typical scope

- Security due diligence and onboarding requirements
- Continuous monitoring of supplier risk signals and material changes
- Contractual controls (e.g., breach notification, audit rights)
- Third-party incident coordination and reporting
