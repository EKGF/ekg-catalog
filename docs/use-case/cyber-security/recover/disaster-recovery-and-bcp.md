DR and BCP connect technical recovery capabilities to business
commitments: which processes must continue, what downtime is
acceptable, and how decisions are made under pressure.

## Outcomes

- Reduced business disruption during major incidents
- Clear recovery objectives (RTO/RPO) for critical services
- Better alignment between service owners, IT, security, and
  leadership
- Higher confidence through regular exercises and validated plans

## Typical scope

- Continuity plans for critical business processes
- Recovery objectives by service tier
- Failover and restoration strategies (including third-party
  dependencies)
- Exercises and tabletop tests with measurable improvements

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can help draft continuity scenarios, assemble exercise
materials, and track action items—guardrailed by business-owner
approvals for continuity commitments and human facilitation during
real incidents.
