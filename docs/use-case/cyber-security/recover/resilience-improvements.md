Recovery should not end at restoration. This use case focuses on
reducing future impact by making resilience improvements visible,
prioritized, and owned.

## Outcomes

- Reduced future downtime and faster recovery for critical services
- Lower risk of repeat incidents through systemic fixes
- Clear prioritization of resilience investments by business impact
- Measurable maturity improvements over time

## Typical scope

- Post-incident resilience backlog (prioritized, funded, owned)
- Architecture hardening and dependency reduction for critical paths
- Automation of recovery runbooks and validation steps
- Regular reviews of whether resilience objectives are being met

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can help synthesize recurring themes across incidents, draft
prioritized improvement backlogs, and produce leadership
reporting—guardrailed by business ownership of priorities and
transparent evidence for trade-offs.
