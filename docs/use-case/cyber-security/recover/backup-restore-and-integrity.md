Restoring from backup is not just a technical activity: it is a
business risk decision about what can be trusted, what must be
revalidated, and how quickly operations can resume.

## Outcomes

- Reduced downtime and data loss aligned to business recovery
  objectives
- Lower risk of reintroducing compromised data or systems
- More reliable recovery through repeatable restore practices
- Clear evidence of recovery actions for regulators and auditors

## Typical scope

- Restore procedures for critical applications and datasets
- Integrity checks and validation criteria (what “good” looks like)
- Segregated recovery environments and clean-room approaches when
  needed
- Regular restore testing and improvement loops

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can help draft restore plans, compile integrity evidence, and
produce executive-ready recovery summaries—guardrailed by human
approval for restore actions and strict controls to prevent unsafe
automation during incidents.
