Service restoration is where business continuity commitments are met
in practice: which services return first, how integrity is validated,
and how stakeholders are informed.

## Outcomes

- Faster return of critical customer-facing and revenue-generating
  services
- Reduced risk of restoring compromised systems
- Clear recovery priorities aligned to business impact
- Improved confidence through validation and documented decisions

## Typical scope

- Service prioritization and recovery sequencing
- Recovery runbooks and decision checkpoints
- Integrity validation (data correctness, system trust)
- Stakeholder updates and service owner coordination

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can help assemble restoration checklists, summarize
dependencies and priorities, and draft stakeholder updates—guardrailed
by explicit approvals for restoration decisions and traceable evidence
for integrity validation.
