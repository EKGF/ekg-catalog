SaaS concentrates risk in identity, configuration, and vendor
dependency. The business must ensure the right controls exist even
when systems are operated externally.

## Outcomes

- Reduced risk from misconfiguration and over-privileged access
- Better visibility into data exposure and sharing
- Clear accountability for vendor security requirements and changes
- Faster response when SaaS incidents occur (provider coordination)

## What to consider

- Vendor due diligence, contracts, and breach notification obligations
- SSO/MFA enforcement and privileged access governance
- SaaS configuration baselines and continuous review
- Telemetry and audit logs availability and retention
