Cloud changes how security is delivered: control is often
configuration- and identity-driven, and responsibility is shared with
providers.

## Outcomes

- Clear accountability under shared responsibility models
- Faster detection and remediation of cloud misconfigurations
- More consistent guardrails across cloud accounts and environments
- Better risk visibility for critical cloud-hosted services

## What to consider

- Shared responsibility and supplier dependency management
- Identity-centric access control and privileged access governance
- Configuration baselines and drift at scale
- Telemetry coverage for cloud-native services and APIs
