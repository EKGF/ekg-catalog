Cybersecurity capabilities are often the same in principle, but differ
in execution depending on context. These context pages highlight what
changes and what must be considered when applying the capabilities in
that environment.

## Outcomes

- Reduced duplication by centralizing context-specific considerations
- More consistent security decisions across environments
- Faster onboarding of teams by clarifying “how this works here”

## Contexts

- [SaaS](saas/index.md)
- [OT/ICS](ot-ics/index.md)
