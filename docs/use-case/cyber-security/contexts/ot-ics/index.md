OT/ICS environments often have different priorities and constraints
than IT: availability and safety are paramount, patching may be
constrained, and connectivity changes can have operational
consequences.

## Outcomes

- Reduced risk of operational disruption and safety incidents
- Better visibility of OT assets, connectivity, and exposure
- More realistic security controls aligned to OT constraints
- Clear decision-making for IT/OT boundary changes and exceptions

## What to consider

- Safety and uptime requirements as primary constraints
- Legacy systems with limited patching and monitoring options
- Segmentation and controlled IT/OT integration pathways
- Incident response coordination with operations teams
