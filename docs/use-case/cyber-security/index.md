Cybersecurity is a business capability: it protects revenue, customer
trust, operational continuity, and regulatory standing. This tree
organizes the key capabilities in a way that helps business analysts
and stakeholders discuss scope, ownership, outcomes, and dependencies.

## Outcomes

- Reduced likelihood and impact of cyber incidents
- Faster detection and response, with clearer accountability
- Improved audit readiness and evidence quality
- Better prioritization of security investments based on business
  criticality
- Increased resilience and faster recovery for critical services

## Components

- [Govern](govern/index.md) — operating model, policies, risk,
  compliance
- [Identify](identify/index.md) — understand assets, exposures, and
  scenarios
- [Protect](protect/index.md) — preventative controls and risk
  reduction
- [Detect](detect/index.md) — monitoring, alerting, and investigation
  triggers
- [Respond](respond/index.md) — incident handling and communications
- [Recover](recover/index.md) — restoration, continuity, and
  resilience

## GenAI-enabled execution

GenAI can accelerate security work by delegating well-scoped tasks to
highly specialised autonomous agents (e.g., triage assistant, evidence
collector, policy mapper, incident scribe). These agents must be
**guardrailed** by approved scope, explicit approvals for high-impact
actions, and traceable provenance of every claim and artifact. An EKG
can provide the authoritative context (assets, owners, dependencies,
controls, incidents, policies) that keeps agent actions relevant and
auditable.
