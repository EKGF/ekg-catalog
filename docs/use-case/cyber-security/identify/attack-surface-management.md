Attack surface management answers a simple business question: “What is
exposed to attackers right now, and who is accountable for reducing
that exposure?”

## Outcomes

- Fewer unknown internet-facing assets and services
- Faster remediation of high-risk exposures and misconfigurations
- Clear ownership for externally reachable services and domains
- Better prioritization based on criticality and blast radius

## Typical scope

- External attack surface (domains, certificates, exposed services)
- Internal exposure (east-west paths, critical management interfaces)
- Ownership and escalation pathways for “unknown” assets
- Exposure reduction targets and reporting
