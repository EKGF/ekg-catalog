Not all data and services are equal. This use case helps the business
agree what is most sensitive and what is most critical, so protection
and response plans focus where it matters.

## Outcomes

- Clear handling requirements for sensitive data
- Better prioritization of controls and monitoring based on
  criticality
- Faster, more consistent incident classification and escalation
- Improved compliance with privacy and sector regulations

## Typical scope

- Classification schemes (sensitivity, confidentiality, retention)
- Critical service tiers (availability and recovery expectations)
- Mapping to required controls (access, encryption, monitoring,
  backups)
- Review and governance (who can change classifications)
