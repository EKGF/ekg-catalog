Threat modeling is valuable when it produces shared, decision-ready
scenarios that the business can act on (investments, control choices,
response plans).

## Outcomes

- Clear set of priority cyber scenarios linked to business impact
- Better alignment between controls, detection, and response plans
- More realistic tabletop exercises and readiness assessments
- Faster decision-making during real incidents (pre-agreed playbooks)

## Typical scope

- Scenario catalog (e.g., ransomware, data theft, supplier compromise)
- Mapping scenarios to critical services and dependencies
- Control and detection coverage gaps
- Response playbooks and escalation criteria

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can help draft scenario narratives, map scenarios to affected
assets and obligations, and prepare tabletop materials—guardrailed by
approved taxonomies and human validation of assumptions.
