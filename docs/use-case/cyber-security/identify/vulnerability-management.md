Vulnerability management is most effective when it is risk-based: it
combines technical findings with business context (criticality,
exposure, dependencies) to decide what to fix first.

## Outcomes

- Reduced likelihood of exploitation on critical assets
- Clear remediation priorities and accountable owners
- Faster time-to-remediate for high-risk findings
- Better reporting focused on risk reduction, not volume

## Typical scope

- Discovery across infrastructure, applications, and dependencies
- Risk-based prioritization (critical services, exploitability,
  exposure)
- Remediation workflow and SLAs
- Exception handling and compensating controls

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can help classify findings, draft remediation tickets, and
summarize impact for stakeholders—guardrailed by approved
prioritization rules and human review for risk acceptance.
