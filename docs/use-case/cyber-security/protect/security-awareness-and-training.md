People are part of every security control system. Awareness programs
work best when they are role-based, measurable, and tied to real
business processes.

## Outcomes

- Reduced success rate of phishing and social engineering attacks
- Faster reporting of suspicious activity by staff
- Fewer policy violations caused by misunderstanding
- Stronger security culture and shared accountability

## Typical scope

- Role-based training (executives, developers, finance, HR, support)
- Phishing simulations and targeted coaching
- Clear reporting pathways and reinforcement mechanisms
- Measurement (risk reduction, reporting rates, repeat issues)
