Privileged accounts can bypass normal controls and cause outsized
business impact. PAM focuses on making privileged access rare,
controlled, and auditable.

## Outcomes

- Reduced risk of catastrophic breaches from privileged misuse
- Better traceability of administrative actions for investigations and
  audits
- Faster containment during incidents (disable/rotate privileged
  access)
- More consistent operational discipline (break-glass use is explicit)

## Typical scope

- Just-in-time / time-bound privileged access
- Strong authentication and step-up approvals for sensitive actions
- Session monitoring and logging for privileged activity
- Break-glass procedures and emergency access governance
- Privilege minimization (remove standing admin where possible)

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can help review privileged access requests, flag policy
conflicts, and summarize privileged activity for audits—guardrailed by
strict approval rules and mandatory human authorization for sensitive
access and actions.
