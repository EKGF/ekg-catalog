Applications and APIs are often the most direct path to customer data
and critical business functions. This use case focuses on preventing
and minimizing exploitable weaknesses.

## Outcomes

- Fewer high-impact vulnerabilities reaching production
- Reduced likelihood of data exposure through insecure APIs
- Faster, safer releases through clear security requirements
- Improved confidence in third-party and open-source dependency use

## Typical scope

- Security requirements for critical applications and APIs
- Risk-based testing and review practices (before and after release)
- Dependency risk management and remediation workflows
- API security posture (authentication, authorization, abuse
  prevention)

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can help summarize findings, draft remediation tickets, and
produce business-friendly impact statements—guardrailed by approved
risk models and human review of high-impact decisions.
