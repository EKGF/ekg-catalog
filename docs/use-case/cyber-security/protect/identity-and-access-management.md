Identity and access decisions sit at the center of most security and
compliance outcomes. IAM defines how identities are created, verified,
authorized, and retired across the organization.

## Outcomes

- Reduced unauthorized access and account misuse
- Faster onboarding/offboarding with less operational friction
- Clear accountability for access approvals and exceptions
- Improved audit readiness (who had access, when, and why)
- Lower likelihood of breaches caused by credential compromise

## Typical scope

- Identity lifecycle (joiner/mover/leaver)
- Authentication approaches (including MFA and strong authentication)
- Authorization models (roles, attributes, least privilege)
- Access reviews and certification for sensitive systems
- Non-human identities (service accounts, workloads, integrations)

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can help triage access requests, identify policy conflicts, and
draft approvals/denials with rationale—guardrailed by clear policies,
mandatory approvals for high-impact access, and traceable evidence for
decisions.
