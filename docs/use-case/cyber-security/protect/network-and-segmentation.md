Segmentation is a business resilience control: it reduces blast radius
by making it harder for attackers (or mistakes) to move from one area
of the environment to another.

## Outcomes

- Reduced lateral movement and blast radius during incidents
- Clearer control of who/what can reach critical systems
- Improved reliability through more intentional connectivity
- Faster containment actions (isolate segments with known impact)

## Typical scope

- Segmentation strategy based on critical services and data
  sensitivity
- Controlled ingress/egress paths and remote access controls
- Exceptions management for legacy connectivity needs
- Monitoring and reporting of boundary violations

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can help draft segmentation proposals, summarize exception
impact, and produce “blast radius” narratives for
stakeholders—guardrailed by approved architecture patterns and
required human approval for connectivity changes.
