Backups are only valuable if they can be restored quickly and safely.
This use case focuses on resilience controls that reduce downtime and
limit data loss when incidents occur.

## Outcomes

- Faster restoration of critical services after disruption
- Reduced data loss aligned to recovery objectives (RTO/RPO)
- Improved readiness against ransomware and destructive attacks
- Higher confidence through regular recovery testing

## Typical scope

- Recovery objectives for critical services (tiers and expectations)
- Backup coverage, retention, and segregation practices
- Restore testing and validation (including integrity checks)
- Operational ownership and runbooks for recovery

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can help coordinate restore testing schedules, draft recovery
runbooks, and summarize recovery readiness for executives—guardrailed
by required human approvals for any production recovery actions and
traceable evidence of tests.
