Misconfiguration is a frequent cause of incidents. This use case
focuses on setting clear baselines and ensuring they remain in place
as environments change.

## Outcomes

- Fewer incidents caused by insecure defaults and configuration drift
- Faster detection and remediation of high-risk misconfigurations
- More consistent compliance with baseline security requirements
- Reduced operational overhead through standardization

## Typical scope

- Baseline configurations for operating systems, cloud accounts, and
  platforms
- Configuration compliance reporting and exception handling
- Drift detection and remediation workflows
- Patch and update practices aligned to risk and criticality

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can help identify baseline gaps, explain configuration risk in
business terms, and draft remediation plans—guardrailed by approved
standards and human review before applying disruptive changes.
