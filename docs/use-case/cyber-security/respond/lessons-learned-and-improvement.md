Post-incident learning prevents repeating the same failures. The goal
is not to assign blame, but to improve systems, processes, and
decision-making.

## Outcomes

- Reduced recurrence of similar incidents
- Clear accountability for follow-up actions and deadlines
- Better controls, detections, and response playbooks over time
- Improved executive visibility into systemic risk and progress

## Typical scope

- Structured post-incident reviews (including “near misses”)
- Root cause and contributing factor analysis
- Action tracking (owner, priority, deadline, verification)
- Metrics and reporting (trend analysis, recurring themes)

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can help draft post-incident reports, cluster recurring root
causes, and track action completion—guardrailed by human ownership of
conclusions and transparent linkage to evidence.
