Incident communications are a business-critical function. Poor
communication can amplify financial, legal, and reputational impact
even when technical containment is effective.

## Outcomes

- Faster, more consistent stakeholder updates during incidents
- Reduced reputational impact through clear and accurate messaging
- Better compliance with notification obligations and timelines
- Clear coordination between security, legal, risk, and communications
  teams

## Typical scope

- Stakeholder mapping (executives, service owners, customers,
  regulators)
- Decision gates for disclosure (what is known, what is confirmed)
- Message templates and approval workflows
- Post-incident communications and customer support alignment

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can draft status updates, FAQs, and regulator-ready narratives,
while human approval remains mandatory before any external
communication.
