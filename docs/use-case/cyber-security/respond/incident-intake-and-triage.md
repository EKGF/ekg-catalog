Incident intake and triage ensures signals (alerts, reports,
anomalies) turn into timely decisions. It prevents delays caused by
unclear thresholds, ownership, or escalation paths.

## Outcomes

- Faster time-to-triage and clearer prioritization
- Consistent severity classification aligned to business criticality
- Reduced confusion during high-pressure situations
- Better coordination across security, IT, service owners, and
  leadership

## Typical scope

- What qualifies as an incident vs. an operational issue
- Severity and impact criteria (service tier, data sensitivity,
  exposure)
- Routing rules and on-call responsibilities
- Initial containment decision framework and approvals

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can summarize incoming reports, propose severity, and draft
case records, while approvals remain with accountable incident leaders
for high-impact actions and communications.
