Containment decisions must balance speed with business impact:
isolating the right systems quickly while avoiding unnecessary
disruption.

## Outcomes

- Reduced blast radius and faster stabilization of critical services
- Lower likelihood of repeat compromise from the same foothold
- More predictable response actions with clear approvals
- Better coordination between security and service owners

## Typical scope

- Containment playbooks (network isolation, credential resets,
  blocking)
- Decision rights and approvals for disruptive actions
- Eradication steps (remove persistence, patch exploited weaknesses)
- Verification of clean state before restoration

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can propose containment options and draft execution checklists,
but high-impact actions should require human approval and produce
traceable evidence of what was done and why.
