Investigation and forensics focus on establishing the facts and scope
of an incident with sufficient evidence for business decisions, legal
defensibility, and learning.

## Outcomes

- Clear understanding of impacted services, data, and customers
- Faster containment decisions with higher confidence
- Stronger evidence for regulators, auditors, insurers, and legal
  teams
- Improved root-cause understanding to prevent recurrence

## Typical scope

- Evidence collection and preservation (chain-of-custody where needed)
- Timeline reconstruction and scope assessment
- Attribution and root cause analysis (where feasible)
- Decision support for containment, disclosure, and recovery
  priorities

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can help summarize timelines, correlate artifacts, and draft
incident reports—guardrailed by strict data-access controls, privacy
requirements, and human validation of conclusions before external use.
