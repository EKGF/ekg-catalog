Logging and telemetry provide the evidence layer for security
decisions: what happened, where, when, and who was affected. Without
consistent telemetry, monitoring and investigations become slow and
unreliable.

## Outcomes

- Reduced blind spots for critical services and data flows
- Faster incident investigation with higher confidence in findings
- Better audit evidence and control validation through reliable
  records
- Clearer ownership of “telemetry gaps” with measurable improvement
  plans

## Typical scope

- Telemetry requirements by service criticality and data sensitivity
- Collection, normalization, retention, and access governance
- Integrity expectations for logs (tamper resistance, provenance)
- Cost and performance management for telemetry at scale

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can help identify telemetry gaps, draft remediation tasks, and
produce incident timelines—guardrailed by approved data-access rules,
privacy constraints, and traceable sources for every claim.
