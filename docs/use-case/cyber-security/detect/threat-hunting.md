Threat hunting is proactive assurance: it tests assumptions about
visibility, control effectiveness, and attacker behavior before a
major incident forces the issue.

## Outcomes

- Earlier discovery of stealthy threats and control gaps
- Improved detection content based on real findings
- Better understanding of attacker paths and business impact
- Stronger preparedness through repeatable hunt playbooks

## Typical scope

- Hypothesis-driven hunts aligned to priority threat scenarios
- Access to relevant telemetry with privacy safeguards
- Documentation of findings and follow-up actions
- Feedback into detection engineering and control improvements

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can assist with hypothesis generation, query drafting, and
result summarization—guardrailed by approved hunt scopes, privacy
constraints, and analyst validation of conclusions.
