Security monitoring only creates value when it reliably drives
decisions and actions. This use case focuses on operating monitoring
as a service with clear priorities, quality measures, and escalation
paths.

## Outcomes

- Lower mean-time-to-detect (MTTD) for critical threats
- Reduced alert noise and improved analyst productivity
- Consistent triage and escalation aligned to business impact
- Better reporting on detection coverage and operational performance

## Typical scope

- Alert triage and case management processes
- Prioritization by service tier, data sensitivity, and threat
  severity
- Escalation pathways (IT, service owners, legal, risk)
- Monitoring service metrics (quality, timeliness, backlog, coverage)

## GenAI-enabled execution

Autonomous specialist agents can triage alerts, enrich cases, and
draft analyst summaries, while humans retain authority over
high-impact actions (containment, account suspension, customer
disclosures).
