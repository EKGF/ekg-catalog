Detections are business decisions encoded into monitoring logic: what
signals matter, what risk they represent, and what response they
should trigger.

## Outcomes

- Higher-quality alerts with fewer false positives
- Faster adaptation to new threats and business changes
- Clearer coverage mapping from scenarios to detections
- Measurable improvement in detection performance over time

## Typical scope

- Detection lifecycle (design, test, deploy, tune, retire)
- Mapping detections to threat scenarios and critical services
- Validation and testing practices (including regression checks)
- Governance for changes (approvals, documentation, evidence)

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can propose detection improvements, summarize rule changes, and
assist with tuning recommendations—guardrailed by approved detection
standards, privacy constraints, and human review before production
impact.
