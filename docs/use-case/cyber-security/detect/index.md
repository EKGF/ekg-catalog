Detection is the bridge between preventative controls and effective
response: it determines how quickly the business becomes aware of a
threat.

## Outcomes

- Faster detection of attacks and misconfigurations
- Higher-quality alerts with lower noise
- Improved situational awareness for executives and service owners
- Better prioritization of response actions based on impact

## What this includes

- Logging and telemetry strategy (coverage, quality, retention)
- SOC monitoring and alerting (correlation, case management)
- Detection engineering (rule lifecycle, validation, tuning)
- Threat intelligence integration and enrichment
- Threat hunting and proactive discovery
- Anomaly and behavior-based detection

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can assist with alert summarization, enrichment, and
hypothesis-driven hunting, but must be constrained by approved
detection logic, privacy requirements, and mandatory human review for
containment actions.
