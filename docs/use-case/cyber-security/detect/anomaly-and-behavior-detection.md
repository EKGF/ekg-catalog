Anomaly and behavior detection helps identify threats that don’t match
known patterns. It is most useful when aligned to business context and
governed to avoid privacy and fairness issues.

## Outcomes

- Earlier detection of novel attacks and insider-risk signals
- Reduced time to identify scope and impacted assets
- Better prioritization of investigations by criticality and risk
- Stronger governance of behavioral monitoring to protect trust

## Typical scope

- Behavior baselines aligned to roles and service criticality
- Investigation triggers and escalation criteria
- Governance for privacy, proportionality, and acceptable use
- Continuous tuning to reduce noise and false positives

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can help surface and summarize anomalies, propose investigative
next steps, and draft case narratives—guardrailed by privacy
governance and human review before any action that affects people or
customers.
