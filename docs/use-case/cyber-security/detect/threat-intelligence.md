Threat intelligence creates value when it is relevant and actionable:
it helps the business decide where to focus defenses and how urgently
to act.

## Outcomes

- Faster awareness of emerging threats relevant to the organization
- Better prioritization of remediation and detection efforts
- Improved investigations through enrichment and context
- Reduced wasted effort on low-relevance intelligence noise

## Typical scope

- Intelligence sources and relevance criteria
- Enrichment of alerts and cases with intel context
- Prioritization of actions (patching, blocking, monitoring changes)
- Reporting for business stakeholders (what changed, what it means)

## GenAI-enabled execution

Agents can summarize intel, assess relevance against the
organization’s profile, and draft recommended actions—guardrailed by
explicit acceptance criteria and human review for disruptive changes.
