# Enterprise Risk & Compliance Management

## Summary

Enterprise risk and compliance management requires monitoring and
managing risk and compliance across all regulatory requirements,
business units, and jurisdictions in real-time. Risk and compliance
require understanding relationships between regulations, business
processes, data lineage, and organizational structures.

Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG) technology provides the semantic
foundation to model and query these complex relationships, enabling
proactive risk management and automated compliance reporting.

## The Challenge

Modern risk and compliance management must:

- Monitor compliance across multiple regulatory requirements
- Understand relationships between regulations and business processes
- Track data lineage for compliance reporting
- Manage risk across business units and jurisdictions
- Respond to regulatory changes in real-time
- Provide audit trails and evidence for compliance

Traditional approaches cannot effectively model or query these complex
relationships across siloed systems and organizational structures.

## Why EKG is Required

Risk and compliance require understanding relationships between
regulations, business processes, data lineage, and organizational
structures. EKG provides:

- **Semantic relationship modeling** — Ontologies enable precise
  modeling of regulatory requirements and business processes
- **Cross-system visibility** — Semantic relationships enable queries
  across all systems and organizational units
- **Data lineage tracking** — Graph structure enables automatic tracking
  of data flows for compliance
- **Regulatory mapping** — Relationships between regulations and
  business processes can be modeled and queried
- **Real-time monitoring** — Graph queries enable real-time risk and
  compliance monitoring
- **Automated reporting** — Graph queries enable automated generation
  of compliance reports

## Business Value

- **Reduced regulatory fines** — Proactive compliance reduces risk of
  violations
- **Faster compliance reporting** — Automated generation reduces time
  to produce reports
- **Proactive risk management** — Early identification of risks enables
  mitigation
- **Cost reduction** — Automation reduces manual compliance effort
- **Better decision-making** — Comprehensive risk view enables informed
  decisions
