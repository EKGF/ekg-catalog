  Enterprise Risk & Compliance Management
summary: >-
  Enterprise risk and compliance management monitors compliance across multiple regulatory requirements, understands relationships between regulations and business processes, tracks data lineage for compliance reporting, and manages risk across business units and jurisdictions. This use case addresses modeling regulatory requirements semantically, providing cross-system visibility, enabling automated compliance reporting, responding to regulatory changes in real-time, and providing complete audit trails and evidence for compliance demonstrations.

## The Challenge

Modern risk and compliance management must:

- Monitor compliance across multiple regulatory requirements
- Understand relationships between regulations and business processes
- Track data lineage for compliance reporting
- Manage risk across business units and jurisdictions
- Respond to regulatory changes in real-time
- Provide audit trails and evidence for compliance

Traditional approaches cannot effectively model or query these complex
relationships across siloed systems and organizational structures.

## Why EKG is Required

Risk and compliance require understanding relationships between
regulations, business processes, data lineage, and organizational
structures. EKG provides:

- **Semantic relationship modeling** — Ontologies enable precise
  modeling of regulatory requirements and business processes
- **Cross-system visibility** — Semantic relationships enable queries
  across all systems and organizational units
- **Data lineage tracking** — Graph structure enables automatic
  tracking of data flows for compliance
- **Regulatory mapping** — Relationships between regulations and
  business processes can be modeled and queried
- **Real-time monitoring** — Graph queries enable real-time risk and
  compliance monitoring
- **Automated reporting** — Graph queries enable automated generation
  of compliance reports

## Business Value

- **Reduced regulatory fines** — Proactive compliance reduces risk of
  violations
- **Faster compliance reporting** — Automated generation reduces time
  to produce reports
- **Proactive risk management** — Early identification of risks
  enables mitigation
- **Cost reduction** — Automation reduces manual compliance effort
- **Better decision-making** — Comprehensive risk view enables
  informed decisions
