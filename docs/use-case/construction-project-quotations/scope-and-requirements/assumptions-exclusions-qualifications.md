# Assumptions, Exclusions & Qualifications

<object data="../../../diagrams/out/assumptions-exclusions-qualifications.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Make the “unknowns” explicit: document assumptions, exclusions, and
qualifications so the quotation is defensible and downstream delivery
teams know what was priced (and what was not).

- **Typical inputs**: tender documents, design gaps, site constraints,
  clarifications, internal standards
- **Typical outputs**: assumptions register, exclusions list,
  qualification statements linked to scope and pricing
- **EKG + GenAI**: propose draft assumptions from document gaps, detect
  conflicts with requirements, and ensure each assumption is traceable
  to evidence and impacts.
