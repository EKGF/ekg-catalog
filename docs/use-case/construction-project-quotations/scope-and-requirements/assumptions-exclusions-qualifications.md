  Assumptions, Exclusions & Qualifications
summary: >-
  Assumptions, exclusions and qualifications make the unknowns explicit by documenting assumptions, exclusions, and qualifications so the quotation is defensible and downstream delivery teams know what was priced and what was not. This use case uses GenAI to propose draft assumptions from document gaps, detects conflicts with requirements, ensures each assumption is traceable to evidence and impacts through EKG relationships, and links qualification statements to scope and pricing.

Make the “unknowns” explicit: document assumptions, exclusions, and
qualifications so the quotation is defensible and downstream delivery
teams know what was priced (and what was not).

- **Typical inputs**: tender documents, design gaps, site constraints,
  clarifications, internal standards
- **Typical outputs**: assumptions register, exclusions list,
  qualification statements linked to scope and pricing
- **EKG + GenAI**: propose draft assumptions from document gaps,
  detect conflicts with requirements, and ensure each assumption is
  traceable to evidence and impacts.
