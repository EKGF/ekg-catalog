summary: >-
  RFIs, clarifications and addenda manages questions, clarifications, and addenda as first-class knowledge and propagates every change to the affected scope, estimate, risks, and proposal text. This use case uses GenAI to extract changes from addenda and revised documents, identifies impacted WBS/BoQ items through EKG relationships, generates what changed and why summaries with provenance, and maintains RFI logs with resolved requirements and change impacts.

Manage questions, clarifications, and addenda as first-class
knowledge, and propagate every change to the affected scope, estimate,
risks, and proposal text.

- **Typical inputs**: RFI questions/responses, addenda PDFs, revised
  drawings/specs, meeting notes
- **Typical outputs**: RFI log, resolved requirements, change impacts,
  updated scope and pricing baselines
- **EKG + GenAI**: extract changes, identify impacted WBS/BoQ items,
  and generate a “what changed and why” summary with provenance.
