# RFIs, Clarifications & Addenda

<object data="../../../../diagrams/out/rfis-clarifications-addenda.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Manage questions, clarifications, and addenda as first-class knowledge,
and propagate every change to the affected scope, estimate, risks, and
proposal text.

- **Typical inputs**: RFI questions/responses, addenda PDFs, revised
  drawings/specs, meeting notes
- **Typical outputs**: RFI log, resolved requirements, change impacts,
  updated scope and pricing baselines
- **EKG + GenAI**: extract changes, identify impacted WBS/BoQ items, and
  generate a “what changed and why” summary with provenance.
