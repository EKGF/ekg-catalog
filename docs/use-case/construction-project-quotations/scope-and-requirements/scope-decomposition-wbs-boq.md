# Scope Decomposition (WBS/BoQ)

<object data="../../../diagrams/out/scope-decomposition-wbs-boq.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Decompose the tender scope into a consistent structure (WBS/BoQ/cost
codes) so estimating, procurement, risk, and proposal assembly can work
off the same “scope backbone.”

- **Typical inputs**: drawings/specs, client BoQ, WBS templates,
  classification standards, historical packages
- **Typical outputs**: WBS/BoQ structure, work packages, scope ownership,
  mapping to quantities and pricing items
- **EKG + GenAI**: extract scope items from documents and map them to
  standardized taxonomies, keeping traceable links to sources and
  downstream estimate lines.
