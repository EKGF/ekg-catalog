  Scope Decomposition (WBS/BoQ)
summary: >-
  Scope decomposition breaks down the tender scope into a consistent structure (WBS/BoQ/cost codes) so estimating, procurement, risk, and proposal assembly can work off the same scope backbone. This use case uses GenAI to extract scope items from documents and map them to standardized taxonomies, maintains traceable links to sources and downstream estimate lines through EKG relationships, and creates work packages with scope ownership and mapping to quantities and pricing items.

Decompose the tender scope into a consistent structure (WBS/BoQ/cost
codes) so estimating, procurement, risk, and proposal assembly can
work off the same “scope backbone.”

- **Typical inputs**: drawings/specs, client BoQ, WBS templates,
  classification standards, historical packages
- **Typical outputs**: WBS/BoQ structure, work packages, scope
  ownership, mapping to quantities and pricing items
- **EKG + GenAI**: extract scope items from documents and map them to
  standardized taxonomies, keeping traceable links to sources and
  downstream estimate lines.
