# Constructability Review

<object data="../../../diagrams/out/constructability-review.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Review the design for buildability, sequencing, access/logistics, safety,
and temporary works to surface issues early and translate them into cost,
schedule, and risk impacts.

- **Typical inputs**: drawings/specs, BIM models, method statements,
  site constraints, lessons learned
- **Typical outputs**: constructability issues log, proposed
  alternatives/value engineering options, pricing and schedule impacts
- **EKG + GenAI**: connect issues to affected scope items and cost
  drivers, and reuse prior solutions and SME guidance with citations.
