  Constructability Review
summary: >-
  Constructability review evaluates the design for buildability, sequencing, access/logistics, safety, and temporary works to surface issues early and translate them into cost, schedule, and risk impacts. This use case connects issues to affected scope items and cost drivers through EKG relationships, reuses prior solutions and SME guidance with citations using GenAI, and generates constructability issues logs with proposed alternatives, value engineering options, and pricing and schedule impacts.

Review the design for buildability, sequencing, access/logistics,
safety, and temporary works to surface issues early and translate them
into cost, schedule, and risk impacts.

- **Typical inputs**: drawings/specs, BIM models, method statements,
  site constraints, lessons learned
- **Typical outputs**: constructability issues log, proposed
  alternatives/value engineering options, pricing and schedule impacts
- **EKG + GenAI**: connect issues to affected scope items and cost
  drivers, and reuse prior solutions and SME guidance with citations.
