# Contingency & Escalation

<object data="../../../diagrams/out/contingency-and-escalation.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Quantify uncertainty: apply risk-based contingency and price escalation
based on schedule, procurement lead times, market volatility, and known
project risks.

- **Typical inputs**: risk register, schedule assumptions, commodity and
  labor indices, procurement strategy, contract terms
- **Typical outputs**: contingency model and rationale, escalation
  assumptions, scenario impacts, sensitivity summaries
- **EKG + GenAI**: link contingency and escalation to specific risks and
  evidence, run scenario narratives (“what drives the range”), and keep
  traceable justifications for governance and audit.
