  Contingency & Escalation
summary: >-
  Contingency and escalation quantifies uncertainty by applying risk-based contingency and price escalation based on schedule, procurement lead times, market volatility, and known project risks. This use case links contingency and escalation to specific risks and evidence, runs scenario narratives to understand what drives cost ranges, and maintains traceable justifications for governance and audit through EKG relationships.

Quantify uncertainty: apply risk-based contingency and price
escalation based on schedule, procurement lead times, market
volatility, and known project risks.

- **Typical inputs**: risk register, schedule assumptions, commodity
  and labor indices, procurement strategy, contract terms
- **Typical outputs**: contingency model and rationale, escalation
  assumptions, scenario impacts, sensitivity summaries
- **EKG + GenAI**: link contingency and escalation to specific risks
  and evidence, run scenario narratives (“what drives the range”), and
  keep traceable justifications for governance and audit.
