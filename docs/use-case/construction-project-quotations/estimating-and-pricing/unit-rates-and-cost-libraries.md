  Unit Rates & Cost Libraries
summary: >-
  Unit rates and cost libraries maintain and apply consistent cost intelligence including unit rates, assemblies, productivity baselines, and cost codes with traceable sources and context (region, time, project type). This use case connects rates to their sources (projects, vendors, indices), recommends suitable rates for new scope items using GenAI, highlights outliers and stale prices, and maintains cost-code mappings with rate provenance.

Maintain and apply consistent cost intelligence: unit rates,
assemblies, productivity baselines, and cost codes — with traceable
sources and context (region, time, project type).

- **Typical inputs**: historical estimates, vendor quotes, cost
  indices, labor agreements, productivity benchmarks
- **Typical outputs**: approved unit rates/assemblies, cost-code
  mappings, rate provenance, recommended alternates
- **EKG + GenAI**: connect rates to where they came from (projects,
  vendors, indices), recommend suitable rates for a new scope item,
  and highlight outliers and stale prices.
