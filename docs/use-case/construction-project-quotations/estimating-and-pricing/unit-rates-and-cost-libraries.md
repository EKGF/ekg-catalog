# Unit Rates & Cost Libraries

<object data="../../../diagrams/out/unit-rates-and-cost-libraries.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Maintain and apply consistent cost intelligence: unit rates, assemblies,
productivity baselines, and cost codes — with traceable sources and
context (region, time, project type).

- **Typical inputs**: historical estimates, vendor quotes, cost indices,
  labor agreements, productivity benchmarks
- **Typical outputs**: approved unit rates/assemblies, cost-code mappings,
  rate provenance, recommended alternates
- **EKG + GenAI**: connect rates to where they came from (projects,
  vendors, indices), recommend suitable rates for a new scope item, and
  highlight outliers and stale prices.
