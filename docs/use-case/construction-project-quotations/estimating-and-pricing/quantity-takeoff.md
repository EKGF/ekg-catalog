  Quantity Takeoff (2D/3D/BIM)
summary: >-
  Quantity takeoff produces a defensible quantity basis for pricing by measuring and classifying quantities from drawings, specifications, and BIM models, including measurement rules and assumptions. This use case enables extraction of quantities from unstructured documents using GenAI, links each quantity to its source and scope item, flags inconsistencies across revisions, and maintains versioned quantity deltas with traceable assumptions.

Produce a defensible quantity basis for pricing by measuring and
classifying quantities from drawings, specs, and BIM models —
including measurement rules and assumptions.

- **Typical inputs**: drawings/specs, BIM models, measurement rules,
  scope/WBS, takeoff templates
- **Typical outputs**: quantity sheets, quantity-to-BoQ mapping,
  takeoff assumptions, versioned quantity deltas
- **EKG + GenAI**: extract quantities and references from unstructured
  documents, link each quantity to its source and scope item, and flag
  inconsistencies across revisions.
