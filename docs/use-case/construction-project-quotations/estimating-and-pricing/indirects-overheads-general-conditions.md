# Indirects, Overheads & General Conditions

<object data="../../../../diagrams/out/indirects-overheads-general-conditions.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Estimate the “cost of running the job”: site setup, temporary works,
site management, permits, logistics, supervision, QA/QC, and other
indirect costs that are not tied to a single quantity item.

- **Typical inputs**: schedule assumptions, site constraints, staffing
  plans, project execution plans, compliance requirements
- **Typical outputs**: general conditions breakdown, staffing plan,
  temporary facilities/logistics costs, time-dependent cost curves
- **EKG + GenAI**: connect indirects to schedule and constraints, reuse
  templates from similar projects, and keep traceable rationales for why
  each indirect item exists.
