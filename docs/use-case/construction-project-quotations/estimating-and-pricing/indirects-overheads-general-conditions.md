  Indirects, Overheads & General Conditions
summary: >-
  Indirects, overheads and general conditions estimate the cost of running the job including site setup, temporary works, site management, permits, logistics, supervision, QA/QC, and other indirect costs not tied to a single quantity item. This use case connects indirects to schedule and constraints using EKG relationships, reuses templates from similar projects, maintains traceable rationales for each indirect item, and generates time-dependent cost curves and staffing plans.

Estimate the “cost of running the job”: site setup, temporary works,
site management, permits, logistics, supervision, QA/QC, and other
indirect costs that are not tied to a single quantity item.

- **Typical inputs**: schedule assumptions, site constraints, staffing
  plans, project execution plans, compliance requirements
- **Typical outputs**: general conditions breakdown, staffing plan,
  temporary facilities/logistics costs, time-dependent cost curves
- **EKG + GenAI**: connect indirects to schedule and constraints,
  reuse templates from similar projects, and keep traceable rationales
  for why each indirect item exists.
