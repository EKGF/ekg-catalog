# Labor Productivity & Crew Modeling

<object data="../../../../diagrams/out/labor-productivity-and-crew-modeling.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Translate scope into labor hours by modeling crews, productivity, shift
patterns, access constraints, and “site realities” that dominate
construction cost and schedule.

- **Typical inputs**: scope/WBS, productivity baselines, site/logistics
  constraints, labor calendars, means-and-methods guidance
- **Typical outputs**: labor hour estimates, crew plans, productivity
  factors, scenario comparisons
- **EKG + GenAI**: capture SME heuristics as structured rules, link
  productivity factors to context (site, method, weather), and support
  scenario-based what-if analysis with traceable assumptions.
