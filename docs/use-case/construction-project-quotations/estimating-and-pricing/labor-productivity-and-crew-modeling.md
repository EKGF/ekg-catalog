  Labor Productivity & Crew Modeling
summary: >-
  Labor productivity and crew modeling translates scope into labor hours by modeling crews, productivity, shift patterns, access constraints, and site realities that dominate construction cost and schedule. This use case captures SME heuristics as structured rules using GenAI, links productivity factors to context (site, method, weather), and supports scenario-based what-if analysis with traceable assumptions for crew plans and productivity factors.

Translate scope into labor hours by modeling crews, productivity,
shift patterns, access constraints, and “site realities” that dominate
construction cost and schedule.

- **Typical inputs**: scope/WBS, productivity baselines,
  site/logistics constraints, labor calendars, means-and-methods
  guidance
- **Typical outputs**: labor hour estimates, crew plans, productivity
  factors, scenario comparisons
- **EKG + GenAI**: capture SME heuristics as structured rules, link
  productivity factors to context (site, method, weather), and support
  scenario-based what-if analysis with traceable assumptions.
