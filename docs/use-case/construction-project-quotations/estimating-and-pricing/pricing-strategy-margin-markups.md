  Pricing Strategy (Margin/Markups)
summary: >-
  Pricing strategy converts cost estimates into bid prices by applying markups, margin targets, commercial terms, and competitive strategy while preserving a clear audit trail of what changed and why. This use case connects pricing decisions to risks, terms, and historical outcomes using EKG relationships, generates negotiation-ready narratives with citations to evidence and assumptions using GenAI, and provides margin analysis with sensitivity ranges and pricing rationale.
