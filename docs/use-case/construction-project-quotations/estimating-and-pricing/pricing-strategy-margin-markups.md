# Pricing Strategy (Margin/Markups)

<object data="../../../diagrams/out/pricing-strategy-margin-markups.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Turn the cost estimate into a bid price by applying markups, margin
targets, commercial terms, and competitive strategy — while preserving a
clear audit trail of what changed and why.

- **Typical inputs**: estimate baseline, risk position, market intel,
  win/loss history, contract terms, strategic priorities
- **Typical outputs**: priced bid, margin analysis, sensitivity ranges,
  pricing rationale and approvals
- **EKG + GenAI**: connect pricing decisions to risks, terms, and
  historical outcomes; generate negotiation-ready narratives with
  citations to evidence and assumptions.
