# Document Ingestion & Knowledge Extraction

<object data="../../../diagrams/out/document-ingestion-and-knowledge-extraction.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Convert large volumes of tender and project documentation (PDFs,
drawings, calculations) into machine-readable knowledge that can be
queried, validated, and reused.

- **Typical inputs**: specs, drawings, schedules, calculations, prior
  bids, standards, addenda
- **Typical outputs**: extracted requirements, entities and
  relationships, structured document metadata, evidence links
- **EKG + GenAI**: use GenAI to extract facts and relationships, then
  use the EKG to validate, de-duplicate, and link them into the
  quotation model with provenance.
