  Document Ingestion & Knowledge Extraction
summary: >-
  Document ingestion and knowledge extraction converts large volumes of tender and project documentation (PDFs, drawings, calculations) into machine-readable knowledge that can be queried, validated, and reused. This use case uses GenAI to extract facts and relationships from unstructured documents, then uses EKG to validate, de-duplicate, and link them into the quotation model with provenance, creating structured document metadata and evidence links.

Convert large volumes of tender and project documentation (PDFs,
drawings, calculations) into machine-readable knowledge that can be
queried, validated, and reused.

- **Typical inputs**: specs, drawings, schedules, calculations, prior
  bids, standards, addenda
- **Typical outputs**: extracted requirements, entities and
  relationships, structured document metadata, evidence links
- **EKG + GenAI**: use GenAI to extract facts and relationships, then
  use the EKG to validate, de-duplicate, and link them into the
  quotation model with provenance.
