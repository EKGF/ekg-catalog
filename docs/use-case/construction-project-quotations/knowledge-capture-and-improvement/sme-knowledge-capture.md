  SME Knowledge Capture
summary: >-
  SME knowledge capture preserves the estimator and engineer know-how that determines real-world cost and risk, including rules of thumb, method choices, constraints, and dependencies, before this knowledge is lost when experts retire. This use case uses GenAI to turn conversations into structured knowledge linked to scope items and evidence, creates reusable rules and patterns, and enables consistent reuse across future quotations through EKG relationships.

Capture the estimator/engineer “know-how” that determines real-world
cost and risk: rules of thumb, method choices, constraints, and
dependencies — before it walks out the door.

- **Typical inputs**: SME interviews, past bids and debriefs,
  estimating guidelines, checklists, lessons learned
- **Typical outputs**: reusable rules/patterns, decision rationales,
  standard methods, controlled vocabularies
- **EKG + GenAI**: turn conversations into structured knowledge linked
  to scope items and evidence, and reuse it consistently across future
  quotations.
