# SME Knowledge Capture

<object data="../../../../diagrams/out/sme-knowledge-capture.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Capture the estimator/engineer “know-how” that determines real-world
cost and risk: rules of thumb, method choices, constraints, and
dependencies — before it walks out the door.

- **Typical inputs**: SME interviews, past bids and debriefs, estimating
  guidelines, checklists, lessons learned
- **Typical outputs**: reusable rules/patterns, decision rationales,
  standard methods, controlled vocabularies
- **EKG + GenAI**: turn conversations into structured knowledge linked
  to scope items and evidence, and reuse it consistently across future
  quotations.
