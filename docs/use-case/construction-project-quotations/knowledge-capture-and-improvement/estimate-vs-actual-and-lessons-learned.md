# Estimate vs Actual & Lessons Learned

<object data="../../../diagrams/out/estimate-vs-actual-and-lessons-learned.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Close the loop by comparing bid assumptions and estimated costs against
actual project outcomes, explaining variances, and feeding validated
insights back into cost libraries and SME knowledge.

- **Typical inputs**: project actuals (costs, quantities, productivity),
  change orders, schedule performance, bid baseline
- **Typical outputs**: variance analysis, updated unit rates and
  productivity factors, reusable lessons learned, risk calibration
- **EKG + GenAI**: align actuals to the original WBS/BoQ, explain drivers
  of variance with traceable evidence, and keep improvements governed
  for reuse.
