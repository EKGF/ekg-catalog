  Traceability & Provenance
summary: >-
  Traceability and provenance makes every number and claim in the quotation explainable by tracking what source it came from, which version, who approved it, and what downstream artifacts it affected. This use case automatically attaches citations at page and section level using GenAI, maintains a graph of dependencies through EKG, generates audit-ready explanations on demand, and provides end-to-end lineage with reproducible calculation and decision histories.

Make every number and claim in the quotation explainable: what source
it came from, which version, who approved it, and what downstream
artifacts it affected.

- **Typical inputs**: documents and versions, extracted facts,
  estimate lines, assumptions, approvals
- **Typical outputs**: end-to-end lineage, citations, audit trails,
  reproducible calculation and decision histories
- **EKG + GenAI**: attach citations automatically
  (page/section-level), keep a graph of dependencies, and generate
  audit-ready explanations on demand.
