# Traceability & Provenance

<object data="../../../diagrams/out/traceability-and-provenance.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Make every number and claim in the quotation explainable: what source it
came from, which version, who approved it, and what downstream artifacts
it affected.

- **Typical inputs**: documents and versions, extracted facts, estimate
  lines, assumptions, approvals
- **Typical outputs**: end-to-end lineage, citations, audit trails,
  reproducible calculation and decision histories
- **EKG + GenAI**: attach citations automatically (page/section-level),
  keep a graph of dependencies, and generate audit-ready explanations
  on demand.
