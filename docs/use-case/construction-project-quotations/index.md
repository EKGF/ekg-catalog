  Complex Construction Project Quotations
summary: >-
  Complex construction project quotations address the challenge of creating accurate, competitive bids for large construction projects by capturing expert knowledge from subject matter experts, processing vast volumes of unstructured documentation (PDFs, diagrams, calculations), and generating reliable quotations. This use case demonstrates how EKG and GenAI work together—EKG provides structured, validated knowledge while GenAI accelerates knowledge extraction and generation, with EKG serving as critical guardrails to ensure reliability and prevent knowledge loss when SMEs retire.

## The Challenge

Complex construction projects face significant challenges in quotation
creation:

- **Heavy reliance on SMEs** — Vast amounts of knowledge reside in the
  heads of experienced specialists
- **Time-intensive process** — Quotations can take weeks or months to
  create
- **High cost** — Significant resources required for quotation
  development
- **Significant risk** — Errors in quotations can lead to major losses
- **Vast documentation** — Enormous volumes of PDFs: previous
  quotations, design specifications, construction diagrams,
  engineering calculations, regulatory requirements
- **Knowledge loss** — When SMEs retire, institutional knowledge is
  lost

Traditional approaches cannot efficiently capture SME knowledge or
process the vast volumes of unstructured documentation.

## Why EKG is Required

Complex construction projects depend on vast amounts of knowledge that
resides in the heads of experienced specialists. This knowledge must
be captured in a structured, machine-readable format. Semantic
knowledge graph technology comes closest to being able to represent
this complex, interconnected knowledge—relationships between
materials, methods, regulations, costs, timelines, and dependencies.

Additionally, construction projects generate enormous volumes of
documentation—previous quotations, design specifications, construction
diagrams, engineering calculations, and regulatory requirements—often
stored as PDFs and other unstructured formats. This documentation must
be captured as machine-readable knowledge to enable reliable quotation
generation.

## The EKG + GenAI Solution

The combination of EKG and GenAI provides a powerful solution:

### EKG Captures Structured Knowledge

- **SME knowledge capture** — Relationships between construction
  components, methods, regulations, and best practices are represented
  in a semantic knowledge graph
- **Structured relationships** — Complex interdependencies between
  materials, methods, regulations, costs, and timelines are modeled
  semantically
- **Reusable knowledge** — Once captured, knowledge can be reused
  across multiple projects

### GenAI Extracts Knowledge from Documents

- **Document processing** — PDFs, diagrams, and calculations are
  processed by GenAI to extract machine-readable knowledge
- **Knowledge extraction** — GenAI identifies relevant information
  from vast volumes of unstructured documentation
- **Feeds into EKG** — Extracted knowledge is structured and added to
  the knowledge graph

### EKG Provides Fact-Checking Guardrails

- **Validation** — GenAI-generated content is validated against the
  structured knowledge in the EKG
- **Reliability** — Ensures accuracy and consistency of generated
  quotations
- **Audit trail** — Complete provenance of how quotations were
  generated

### Combined Intelligence

The EKG's structured knowledge combined with GenAI's document
processing and generation capabilities enables:

- **Rapid quotation creation** — Automated generation from structured
  knowledge
- **Reliable results** — EKG guardrails ensure accuracy
- **Knowledge preservation** — Institutional knowledge is captured and
  preserved
- **Continuous improvement** — Each quotation improves the knowledge
  base

## Business Value

- **Dramatically reduced quotation time** — From weeks/months to
  hours/days
- **Reduced cost** — Less manual effort required
- **Improved accuracy and reliability** — EKG validation ensures
  correctness
- **Reduced risk** — Automated validation reduces error risk
- **Preserved institutional knowledge** — Knowledge is captured and
  reusable
- **Faster response to RFPs** — Quick turnaround creates competitive
  advantage
- **Competitive advantage** — Quicker turnaround wins more business

## How EKG and GenAI Work Together

This use case demonstrates how **EKG and GenAI work together**—EKG
provides the structured, validated knowledge foundation, while GenAI
accelerates knowledge extraction and generation, with EKG serving as
the critical guardrail to ensure reliability.

Without EKG guardrails, relying solely on GenAI would be too risky for
complex construction quotations. Without GenAI, capturing knowledge
from vast volumes of documentation would be prohibitively expensive
and time-consuming. Together, they enable reliable, rapid quotation
generation.
