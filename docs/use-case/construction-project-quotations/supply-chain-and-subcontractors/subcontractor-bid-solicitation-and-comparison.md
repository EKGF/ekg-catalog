# Subcontractor Bid Solicitation & Comparison

<object data="../../../diagrams/out/subcontractor-bid-solicitation-and-comparison.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Run the subcontractor bidding process: invite bidders, manage
clarifications, receive bids, and compare them against scope packages
and compliance requirements.

- **Typical inputs**: scope packages, bidder lists, addenda/RFIs, bid
  submissions, commercial terms
- **Typical outputs**: bid register, compliance checks, comparison
  summaries, clarification questions, shortlist recommendations
- **EKG + GenAI**: parse bids into structured line items, normalize
  pricing against scope definitions, and highlight exclusions and
  missing scope with traceable evidence.
