  Subcontractor Bid Solicitation & Comparison
summary: >-
  Subcontractor bid solicitation and comparison runs the subcontractor bidding process by inviting bidders, managing clarifications, receiving bids, and comparing them against scope packages and compliance requirements. This use case uses GenAI to parse bids into structured line items, normalizes pricing against scope definitions through EKG relationships, highlights exclusions and missing scope with traceable evidence, and generates bid registers with compliance checks and comparison summaries.
