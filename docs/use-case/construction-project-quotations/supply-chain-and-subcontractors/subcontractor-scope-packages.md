# Subcontractor Scope Packages

<object data="../../../diagrams/out/subcontractor-scope-packages.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Create clear, complete scope packages for subcontractors, including
boundaries, interfaces, assumptions, and deliverables — so bids are
comparable and gaps don’t become change orders later.

- **Typical inputs**: WBS/BoQ, drawings/specs, interface lists, package
  templates, constructability notes
- **Typical outputs**: scope package documents, inclusions/exclusions,
  interface matrix, bidder instructions
- **EKG + GenAI**: generate package scope from the structured WBS and
  requirements, validate completeness, and keep traceable links to the
  originating requirements and drawings.
