  Subcontractor Scope Packages
summary: >-
  Subcontractor scope packages create clear, complete scope packages for subcontractors, including boundaries, interfaces, assumptions, and deliverables so bids are comparable and gaps don't become change orders later. This use case uses GenAI to generate package scope from structured WBS and requirements, validates completeness, maintains traceable links to originating requirements and drawings through EKG relationships, and produces scope package documents with inclusions/exclusions and interface matrices.

Create clear, complete scope packages for subcontractors, including
boundaries, interfaces, assumptions, and deliverables — so bids are
comparable and gaps don’t become change orders later.

- **Typical inputs**: WBS/BoQ, drawings/specs, interface lists,
  package templates, constructability notes
- **Typical outputs**: scope package documents, inclusions/exclusions,
  interface matrix, bidder instructions
- **EKG + GenAI**: generate package scope from the structured WBS and
  requirements, validate completeness, and keep traceable links to the
  originating requirements and drawings.
