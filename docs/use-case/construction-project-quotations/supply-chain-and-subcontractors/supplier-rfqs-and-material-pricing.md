# Supplier RFQs & Material Pricing

<object data="../../../diagrams/out/supplier-rfqs-and-material-pricing.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Gather and govern supplier pricing, lead times, and commercial terms so
material cost and availability assumptions are current, comparable, and
traceable.

- **Typical inputs**: BOM/material lists, specs, schedules, RFQ
  templates, vendor responses (PDF/email)
- **Typical outputs**: supplier quote register, pricing assumptions,
  lead-time and availability register, approved alternates
- **EKG + GenAI**: extract price/terms from unstructured quotes, link
  them to materials and scope items, and flag inconsistencies and risks
  (validity windows, exclusions, delivery constraints).
