  Supplier RFQs & Material Pricing
summary: >-
  Supplier RFQs and material pricing gathers and governs supplier pricing, lead times, and commercial terms so material cost and availability assumptions are current, comparable, and traceable. This use case uses GenAI to extract prices and terms from unstructured quotes, links them to materials and scope items through EKG relationships, flags inconsistencies and risks (validity windows, exclusions, delivery constraints), and maintains supplier quote registers with pricing assumptions and approved alternates.

Gather and govern supplier pricing, lead times, and commercial terms
so material cost and availability assumptions are current, comparable,
and traceable.

- **Typical inputs**: BOM/material lists, specs, schedules, RFQ
  templates, vendor responses (PDF/email)
- **Typical outputs**: supplier quote register, pricing assumptions,
  lead-time and availability register, approved alternates
- **EKG + GenAI**: extract price/terms from unstructured quotes, link
  them to materials and scope items, and flag inconsistencies and
  risks (validity windows, exclusions, delivery constraints).
