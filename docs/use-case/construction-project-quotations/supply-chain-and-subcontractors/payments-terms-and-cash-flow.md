  Payments, Terms & Cash Flow
summary: >-
  Payments, terms, and cash flow connects supplier payment terms, subcontractor billing schedules, retention, and client payment milestones to the estimate and execution plan so pricing decisions reflect working capital constraints. This use case uses EKG to link contracts, invoices, pay applications, delivery/acceptance events, and project milestones, enabling scenario analysis of “when do we pay vs when do we get paid” and highlighting funding and liquidity risks early.

Connect payment terms and schedules across suppliers, subcontractors,
and the client to estimating so margin and pricing reflect the real
cash profile of the job.

- **Typical inputs**: supplier/subcontractor contracts, payment terms
  (net/early-pay discounts), delivery & acceptance events, client pay
  milestones, retention rules
- **Typical outputs**: cash-flow scenarios, term compliance checks,
  funding risk flags, payment schedule assumptions embedded into the
  estimate
- **EKG**: relate contract terms ↔ parties ↔ milestones ↔ invoices/pay
  apps ↔ acceptance events; query gaps and peaks in cash needs
