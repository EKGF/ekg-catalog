# Bid Leveling & Comparative Analysis

<object data="../../../diagrams/out/bid-leveling.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Perform apples-to-apples evaluation by normalizing bid scope,
qualifications, and commercial terms into a leveled comparison that
supports award decisions and negotiation strategy.

- **Typical inputs**: received bids, scope packages, clarifications,
  alternates, contract terms, risk posture
- **Typical outputs**: leveled bid sheet, scope gap analysis,
  negotiation points, award recommendation and rationale
- **EKG + GenAI**: build a traceable leveling matrix from bid documents,
  map every bid item to scope requirements, and quantify the cost impact
  of exclusions, alternates, and commercial differences.
