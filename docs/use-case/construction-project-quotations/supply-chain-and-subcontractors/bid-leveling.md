  Bid Leveling & Comparative Analysis
summary: >-
  Bid leveling and comparative analysis performs apples-to-apples evaluation by normalizing bid scope, qualifications, and commercial terms into a leveled comparison that supports award decisions and negotiation strategy. This use case uses GenAI to build traceable leveling matrices from bid documents, maps every bid item to scope requirements through EKG relationships, quantifies the cost impact of exclusions, alternates, and commercial differences, and generates leveled bid sheets with scope gap analysis and award recommendations.

Perform apples-to-apples evaluation by normalizing bid scope,
qualifications, and commercial terms into a leveled comparison that
supports award decisions and negotiation strategy.

- **Typical inputs**: received bids, scope packages, clarifications,
  alternates, contract terms, risk posture
- **Typical outputs**: leveled bid sheet, scope gap analysis,
  negotiation points, award recommendation and rationale
- **EKG + GenAI**: build a traceable leveling matrix from bid
  documents, map every bid item to scope requirements, and quantify
  the cost impact of exclusions, alternates, and commercial
  differences.
