# RFP/RFQ Intake & Document Catalog

<object data="../../../../diagrams/out/rfp-rfq-intake.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Turn an incoming tender pack (RFP/RFQ) into a structured, versioned
document and requirement catalog that downstream estimating, risk, and
proposal assembly can rely on.

- **Typical inputs**: RFP/RFQ pack, drawings, specs, addenda, schedules
- **Typical outputs**: document register, requirement register, open
  issues/questions list, version history
- **EKG + GenAI**: extract clauses, deliverables, dates, and entities
  from PDFs and link them to scope, BoQ/WBS, and assumptions with full
  provenance.
