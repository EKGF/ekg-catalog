  RFP/RFQ Intake & Document Catalog
summary: >-
  RFP/RFQ intake and document catalog transforms an incoming tender pack (RFP/RFQ) into a structured, versioned document and requirement catalog that downstream estimating, risk, and proposal assembly can rely on. This use case uses GenAI to extract clauses, deliverables, dates, and entities from PDFs, links them to scope, BoQ/WBS, and assumptions with full provenance through EKG relationships, and maintains document registers, requirement registers, and version history.

Turn an incoming tender pack (RFP/RFQ) into a structured, versioned
document and requirement catalog that downstream estimating, risk, and
proposal assembly can rely on.

- **Typical inputs**: RFP/RFQ pack, drawings, specs, addenda,
  schedules
- **Typical outputs**: document register, requirement register, open
  issues/questions list, version history
- **EKG + GenAI**: extract clauses, deliverables, dates, and entities
  from PDFs and link them to scope, BoQ/WBS, and assumptions with full
  provenance.
