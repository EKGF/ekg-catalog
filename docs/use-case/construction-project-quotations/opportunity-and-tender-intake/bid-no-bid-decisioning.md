# Bid/No-Bid Decisioning

<object data="../../../diagrams/out/bid-no-bid-decisioning.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Decide whether to pursue a tender based on strategic fit, delivery
capability, commercial attractiveness, and risk exposure — and capture
the rationale as governed knowledge.

- **Typical inputs**: client/opportunity data, scope summary, schedule
  constraints, risk signals, resourcing constraints, win-rate history
- **Typical outputs**: bid/no-bid decision, decision log, risk and
  assumption baselines, next-step actions
- **EKG + GenAI**: connect similar past projects, lessons learned, and
  client constraints to decision criteria; generate a defensible
  narrative with citations to evidence.
