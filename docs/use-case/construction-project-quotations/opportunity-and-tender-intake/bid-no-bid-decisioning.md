  Bid/No-Bid Decisioning
summary: >-
  Bid/no-bid decisioning determines whether to pursue a tender based on strategic fit, delivery capability, commercial attractiveness, and risk exposure, capturing the rationale as governed knowledge. This use case connects similar past projects, lessons learned, and client constraints to decision criteria through EKG relationships, uses GenAI to generate defensible narratives with citations to evidence, and maintains decision logs with risk and assumption baselines.

Decide whether to pursue a tender based on strategic fit, delivery
capability, commercial attractiveness, and risk exposure — and capture
the rationale as governed knowledge.

- **Typical inputs**: client/opportunity data, scope summary, schedule
  constraints, risk signals, resourcing constraints, win-rate history
- **Typical outputs**: bid/no-bid decision, decision log, risk and
  assumption baselines, next-step actions
- **EKG + GenAI**: connect similar past projects, lessons learned, and
  client constraints to decision criteria; generate a defensible
  narrative with citations to evidence.
