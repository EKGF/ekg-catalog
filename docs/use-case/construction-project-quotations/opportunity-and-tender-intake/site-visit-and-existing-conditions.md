# Site Visit & Existing Conditions

<object data="../../../../diagrams/out/site-visit-and-existing-conditions.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Capture the real-world constraints that rarely show up cleanly in the
tender documents: access, logistics, existing assets, utilities,
ground conditions, and safety/environmental constraints.

- **Typical inputs**: site walk notes, photos, surveys, geotech
  reports, as-built drawings, stakeholder interviews
- **Typical outputs**: constraints register, risk items,
  constructability notes, scope clarifications and assumptions
- **EKG + GenAI**: convert unstructured notes and reports into linked
  constraints and risks tied to scope items, methods, and cost
  drivers, with traceable evidence.
