  Site Visit & Existing Conditions
summary: >-
  Site visit and existing conditions captures the real-world constraints that rarely show up cleanly in tender documents, including access, logistics, existing assets, utilities, ground conditions, and safety/environmental constraints. This use case uses GenAI to convert unstructured notes and reports into linked constraints and risks, ties them to scope items, methods, and cost drivers through EKG relationships, and maintains traceable evidence with constraints registers and constructability notes.

Capture the real-world constraints that rarely show up cleanly in the
tender documents: access, logistics, existing assets, utilities,
ground conditions, and safety/environmental constraints.

- **Typical inputs**: site walk notes, photos, surveys, geotech
  reports, as-built drawings, stakeholder interviews
- **Typical outputs**: constraints register, risk items,
  constructability notes, scope clarifications and assumptions
- **EKG + GenAI**: convert unstructured notes and reports into linked
  constraints and risks tied to scope items, methods, and cost
  drivers, with traceable evidence.
