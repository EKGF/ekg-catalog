# Negotiation Support & Revisions

<object data="../../../../diagrams/out/negotiation-support-and-revisions.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Support clarifications, BAFO rounds, and negotiations by tracking
versioned changes to scope, assumptions, pricing, and contract terms —
and producing quick, traceable revisions.

- **Typical inputs**: negotiation questions, addenda/clarifications,
  revised terms, internal approvals, updated supplier/sub bids
- **Typical outputs**: revised bid versions, delta summaries, updated
  qualifications, negotiation positions and evidence
- **EKG + GenAI**: summarize “what changed” across documents and numbers,
  propagate impacts through the linked estimate model, and keep a clear
  provenance chain for each revision.
