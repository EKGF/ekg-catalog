  Negotiation Support & Revisions
summary: >-
  Negotiation support and revisions supports clarifications, BAFO rounds, and negotiations by tracking versioned changes to scope, assumptions, pricing, and contract terms and producing quick, traceable revisions. This use case uses GenAI to summarize what changed across documents and numbers, propagates impacts through the linked estimate model using EKG relationships, maintains clear provenance chains for each revision, and generates revised bid versions with delta summaries and updated qualifications.

Support clarifications, BAFO rounds, and negotiations by tracking
versioned changes to scope, assumptions, pricing, and contract terms —
and producing quick, traceable revisions.

- **Typical inputs**: negotiation questions, addenda/clarifications,
  revised terms, internal approvals, updated supplier/sub bids
- **Typical outputs**: revised bid versions, delta summaries, updated
  qualifications, negotiation positions and evidence
- **EKG + GenAI**: summarize “what changed” across documents and
  numbers, propagate impacts through the linked estimate model, and
  keep a clear provenance chain for each revision.
