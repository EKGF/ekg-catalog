  Proposal Document Generation & Assembly
summary: >-
  Proposal document generation and assembly creates a complete, consistent tender response by generating proposal narrative, technical approach, schedules, and cost breakdowns from the same structured knowledge base used for estimating. This use case uses GenAI to generate coherent narrative grounded in the EKG, ensures terminology and scope alignment across sections, cites sources (requirements, drawings, standards) for defensibility, and produces proposal drafts with executive summaries, technical method statements, and evidence packs.

Assemble a complete, consistent tender response by generating proposal
narrative, technical approach, schedules, and cost breakdowns from the
same structured knowledge base used for estimating.

- **Typical inputs**: requirements register, WBS/BoQ, estimate
  baseline, templates, CVs/project references, compliance obligations
- **Typical outputs**: proposal drafts, executive summary, technical
  method statements, schedules, appendices and evidence pack
- **EKG + GenAI**: generate coherent narrative grounded in the EKG,
  ensure terminology and scope alignment across sections, and cite
  sources (requirements, drawings, standards) for defensibility.
