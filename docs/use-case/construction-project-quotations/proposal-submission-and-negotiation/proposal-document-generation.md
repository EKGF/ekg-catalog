# Proposal Document Generation & Assembly

<object data="../../../../diagrams/out/proposal-document-generation.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Assemble a complete, consistent tender response by generating proposal
narrative, technical approach, schedules, and cost breakdowns from the
same structured knowledge base used for estimating.

- **Typical inputs**: requirements register, WBS/BoQ, estimate baseline,
  templates, CVs/project references, compliance obligations
- **Typical outputs**: proposal drafts, executive summary, technical
  method statements, schedules, appendices and evidence pack
- **EKG + GenAI**: generate coherent narrative grounded in the EKG,
  ensure terminology and scope alignment across sections, and cite
  sources (requirements, drawings, standards) for defensibility.
