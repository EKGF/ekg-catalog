# Compliance Matrix & Submission Packaging

<object data="../../../diagrams/out/compliance-matrix-and-submission-packaging.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Demonstrate compliance by mapping every requirement to the exact
proposal section and evidence, and package the submission so nothing is
missing at deadline time.

- **Typical inputs**: requirements register, client submission rules,
  proposal drafts, appendices, addenda
- **Typical outputs**: compliance matrix, submission checklist, final
  packaged deliverables, traceable evidence map
- **EKG + GenAI**: auto-populate and validate compliance matrices from
  the graph, flag unaddressed requirements, and generate submission
  checklists with provenance.
