  Compliance Matrix & Submission Packaging
summary: >-
  Compliance matrix and submission packaging demonstrates compliance by mapping every requirement to the exact proposal section and evidence, and packages the submission so nothing is missing at deadline time. This use case auto-populates and validates compliance matrices from the EKG graph, uses GenAI to flag unaddressed requirements, generates submission checklists with provenance, and creates traceable evidence maps linking requirements to proposal sections.

is missing at deadline time.

  proposal drafts, appendices, addenda

  the graph, flag unaddressed requirements, and generate submission
  checklists with provenance.
