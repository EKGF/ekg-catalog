# Risk Register & Scenario Analysis

<object data="../../../diagrams/out/risk-register-and-scenario-analysis.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Identify, structure, and quantify risks that drive cost, schedule, and
commercial exposure — and run scenarios to understand ranges, not just
single-point estimates.

- **Typical inputs**: tender requirements, site constraints, contract
  terms, historical lessons learned, SME inputs
- **Typical outputs**: risk register, scenario narratives, contingency
  drivers, sensitivity summaries and approvals
- **EKG + GenAI**: link each risk to evidence (clauses, site notes,
  scope items), propagate impacts into contingency/escalation, and keep
  a traceable rationale for governance.
