  Risk Register & Scenario Analysis
summary: >-
  Risk register and scenario analysis identifies, structures, and quantifies risks that drive cost, schedule, and commercial exposure, running scenarios to understand ranges rather than just single-point estimates. This use case links each risk to evidence (clauses, site notes, scope items) through EKG relationships, propagates impacts into contingency and escalation, uses GenAI to generate scenario narratives, and maintains traceable rationale for governance with sensitivity summaries and approvals.

Identify, structure, and quantify risks that drive cost, schedule, and
commercial exposure — and run scenarios to understand ranges, not just
single-point estimates.

- **Typical inputs**: tender requirements, site constraints, contract
  terms, historical lessons learned, SME inputs
- **Typical outputs**: risk register, scenario narratives, contingency
  drivers, sensitivity summaries and approvals
- **EKG + GenAI**: link each risk to evidence (clauses, site notes,
  scope items), propagate impacts into contingency/escalation, and
  keep a traceable rationale for governance.
