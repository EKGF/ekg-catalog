associated costs, limits, and validity windows.

- **Typical inputs**: tender requirements, contract terms, insurer/surety
  requirements, project risk profile, prior claims/coverage history
- **Typical outputs**: bonds/insurance compliance checklist, costed
  allowances, evidence pack, approval and renewal dates
- **EKG + GenAI**: extract coverage requirements, link them to clauses
  and risks, and keep a traceable record of what was included in the
