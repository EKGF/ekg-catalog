  Regulatory, Safety & Environmental Compliance
summary: >-
  Regulatory, safety and environmental compliance extracts, manages, and validates compliance obligations across building codes, permits, safety, environmental, and client standards, making them auditable requirements rather than tribal knowledge. This use case uses GenAI to extract obligations from documents, maps them to scope and methods through EKG relationships, maintains traceable evidence for each compliance claim, and generates compliance matrices, permit registers, and required deliverables lists.

Extract, manage, and validate compliance obligations across building
codes, permits, safety, environmental, and client standards — and make
them auditable requirements, not “tribal knowledge.”

- **Typical inputs**: regulations/codes, tender requirements, permit
  checklists, HSE standards, environmental constraints
- **Typical outputs**: compliance matrix, permit register, compliance
  gaps/risks, required deliverables list
- **EKG + GenAI**: extract obligations from documents, map them to
  scope and methods, and keep traceable evidence for each compliance
  claim.
