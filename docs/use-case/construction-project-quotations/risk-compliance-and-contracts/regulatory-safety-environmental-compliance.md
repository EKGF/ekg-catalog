# Regulatory, Safety & Environmental Compliance

<object data="../../../../diagrams/out/regulatory-safety-environmental-compliance.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Extract, manage, and validate compliance obligations across building
codes, permits, safety, environmental, and client standards — and make
them auditable requirements, not “tribal knowledge.”

- **Typical inputs**: regulations/codes, tender requirements, permit
  checklists, HSE standards, environmental constraints
- **Typical outputs**: compliance matrix, permit register, compliance
  gaps/risks, required deliverables list
- **EKG + GenAI**: extract obligations from documents, map them to scope
  and methods, and keep traceable evidence for each compliance claim.
