# Contract Terms & Commercial Review

<object data="../../../diagrams/out/contract-terms-and-commercial-review.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

Analyze the contract conditions (payment, LDs, change control, scope
definition, liability, disputes) and translate commercial exposure into
explicit assumptions, qualifications, and pricing/risk decisions.

- **Typical inputs**: draft contract, tender terms, addenda, client
  standard clauses, internal commercial policies
- **Typical outputs**: deviations/qualifications log, commercial risk
  items, negotiation points, approval trail
- **EKG + GenAI**: extract clauses, flag unusual terms vs standards, and
  link each commercial position to the estimate impacts and evidence.
