  Contract Terms & Commercial Review
summary: >-
  Contract terms and commercial review analyzes contract conditions including payment terms, liquidated damages, change control, scope definition, liability, and disputes, translating commercial exposure into explicit assumptions, qualifications, and pricing/risk decisions. This use case uses GenAI to extract clauses and flag unusual terms versus standards, links each commercial position to estimate impacts and evidence through EKG relationships, and maintains deviations/qualifications logs with commercial risk items and negotiation points.

Analyze the contract conditions (payment, LDs, change control, scope
definition, liability, disputes) and translate commercial exposure
into explicit assumptions, qualifications, and pricing/risk decisions.

- **Typical inputs**: draft contract, tender terms, addenda, client
  standard clauses, internal commercial policies
- **Typical outputs**: deviations/qualifications log, commercial risk
  items, negotiation points, approval trail
- **EKG + GenAI**: extract clauses, flag unusual terms vs standards,
  and link each commercial position to the estimate impacts and
  evidence.
