  Enterprise Fraud Detection
summary: >-
  Enterprise fraud detection identifies fraudulent patterns across multiple systems and time periods by analyzing relationships between entities, accounts, transactions, and locations. This use case addresses detecting cross-system fraud patterns, identifying fraud networks and rings, responding in real-time to prevent losses, adapting to evolving fraud patterns, handling massive transaction volumes, and maintaining low false positive rates through graph-based relationship analysis and network detection algorithms.

## The Challenge

Modern fraud detection must:

- Detect patterns across multiple systems and time periods
- Identify relationships between entities that indicate fraud
- Respond in real-time to prevent losses
- Adapt to evolving fraud patterns
- Handle massive volumes of transactions
- Maintain low false positive rates

Traditional approaches struggle with cross-system pattern detection
and cannot effectively model the complex relationships that indicate
fraud.

## Why EKG is Required

Fraud patterns often involve relationships between entities (people,
accounts, transactions, locations) that are not visible in isolated
systems. EKG's graph structure enables:

- **Cross-system pattern detection** — Graph queries can identify
  patterns across all systems, not just isolated views
- **Relationship modeling** — Natural representation of relationships
  between entities that indicate fraud
- **Real-time queries** — Graph structure enables real-time pattern
  detection
- **Temporal analysis** — Graph structure supports time-based pattern
  analysis
- **Network analysis** — Graph algorithms can identify fraud networks
  and rings
- **Adaptive learning** — Graph structure can evolve as new fraud
  patterns are discovered

## Business Value

- **Reduced fraud losses** — Early detection prevents losses
- **Regulatory compliance** — Meets requirements for fraud monitoring
- **Improved security posture** — Better understanding of fraud risks
- **Cost reduction** — Automated detection reduces manual review
- **Competitive advantage** — Superior fraud detection protects
  customers and reputation
