## Summary

Address management for legal entities involves maintaining accurate
and up-to-date information about entity addresses, including
registered addresses, business addresses, mailing addresses, and
operational locations. Address information is critical for legal
compliance, regulatory filings, communication, and understanding
entity geographic presence.

## The Challenge

Organizations face challenges in legal entity address management:

- **Multiple address types** — Entities may have registered, business,
  mailing, and operational addresses
- **Address changes** — Addresses change over time through
  relocations, expansions, and closures
- **Data quality** — Maintaining accurate address data across multiple
  systems and jurisdictions
- **Geographic context** — Understanding addresses in context of
  jurisdictions, regions, and countries
- **Regulatory requirements** — Different jurisdictions require
  different address information for filings
- **Address validation** — Verifying address accuracy and validity
  across different countries
- **Relationship tracking** — Tracking address relationships across
  entity networks (shared offices, subsidiaries)
- **Temporal tracking** — Maintaining historical address records for
  compliance and audit purposes

  assessment
