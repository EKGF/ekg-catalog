  and requirements
- **Liquidation procedures** — Tracking liquidation processes, asset
  sales, and creditor payments
- **Regulatory requirements** — Meeting regulatory requirements for
  status reporting and lifecycle management
- **Temporal tracking** — Maintaining historical records of status and
  lifecycle changes
- **Portfolio management** — Managing entity portfolios across
  different lifecycle stages
