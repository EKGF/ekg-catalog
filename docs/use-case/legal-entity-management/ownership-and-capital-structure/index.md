## The Challenge

Organizations face significant challenges in ownership and capital
structure management:

- **Complex ownership structures** — Entities may have complex
  ownership chains with multiple layers and indirect ownership

  through transactions and corporate actions

  requirements for ownership disclosure and beneficial ownership
  identification
- **Data fragmentation** — Ownership information scattered across
  multiple systems and jurisdictions
- **Corporate actions** — Tracking complex corporate actions and their
  impact on ownership and capital
