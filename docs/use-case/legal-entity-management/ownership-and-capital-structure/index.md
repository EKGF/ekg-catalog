<object data="../../../../diagrams/out/ownership-and-capital-structure.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

## Summary

Ownership and Capital Structure encompasses all aspects of entity
ownership, control, and capital. This includes direct and indirect
ownership, control relationships, share structures, capital issuances,
and corporate actions such as mergers, acquisitions, spin-offs, and
dividends. Understanding ownership and capital structure is essential
for beneficial ownership identification, risk assessment, regulatory
compliance, and corporate finance.

## The Challenge

Organizations face significant challenges in ownership and capital
structure management:

- **Complex ownership structures** — Entities may have complex
  ownership chains with multiple layers and indirect ownership
- **Beneficial ownership** — Identifying ultimate beneficial owners
  through complex ownership chains
- **Control determination** — Determining control relationships beyond
  simple ownership percentages
- **Temporal changes** — Ownership and capital structures change
  through transactions and corporate actions
- **Regulatory requirements** — Different jurisdictions have different
  requirements for ownership disclosure and beneficial ownership
  identification
- **Data fragmentation** — Ownership information scattered across
  multiple systems and jurisdictions
- **Corporate actions** — Tracking complex corporate actions and their
  impact on ownership and capital
