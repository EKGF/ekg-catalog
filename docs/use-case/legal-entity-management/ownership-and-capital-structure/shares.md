  through transactions and corporate actions
- **Regulatory requirements** — Different jurisdictions have different
  requirements for share reporting
- **Valuation complexity** — Determining share values and implications
  of share characteristics
- **Relationship context** — Understanding how shares affect ownership
  and control structures
- **Data quality** — Maintaining accurate and complete share records
