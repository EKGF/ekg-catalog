# Shares

## Summary

Shares management involves tracking and managing information about entity shares, including share types, share classes, share rights, and share ownership. Shares represent ownership interests in entities and determine voting rights, dividend rights, and other shareholder rights. Understanding shares is essential for ownership analysis, corporate governance, and regulatory compliance.

## The Challenge

Organizations face challenges in shares management:

- **Share diversity** — Entities may issue multiple types and classes of shares with different rights
- **Share rights** — Different share classes have different voting, dividend, and liquidation rights
- **Ownership tracking** — Tracking share ownership across shareholders and time periods
- **Temporal changes** — Share ownership and characteristics change through transactions and corporate actions
- **Regulatory requirements** — Different jurisdictions have different requirements for share reporting
- **Valuation complexity** — Determining share values and implications of share characteristics
- **Relationship context** — Understanding how shares affect ownership and control structures
- **Data quality** — Maintaining accurate and complete share records
