  Issued Capital
summary: >-
  Issued capital tracks the actual shares that have been issued to shareholders, distinguishing between authorized share capital and the portion that has been issued, and tracking multiple capital issuances over time with different share types and terms. This use case addresses tracking capital issuances with dates, prices, and terms, linking issued capital to shareholders and allocations, tracking issued capital changes over time, understanding how capital issuances affect ownership and control structures, meeting regulatory requirements for issued capital reporting, and supporting ownership analysis and valuation through comprehensive issuance data.

  which shares in each issuance

  at different points in time
- **Regulatory requirements** — Different jurisdictions have different
  requirements for issued capital reporting

  affect ownership and control structures

  records
