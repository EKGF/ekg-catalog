<object data="../../../../diagrams/out/issued-capital.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

## Summary

Issued capital management involves tracking and managing information
about capital that has been issued by entities to shareholders,
including the number of shares issued, issue dates, issue prices, and
shareholder allocations. Issued capital represents the actual capital
raised by entities and is distinct from authorized capital.
Understanding issued capital is essential for ownership analysis,
valuation, and regulatory compliance.

## The Challenge

Organizations face challenges in issued capital management:

- **Multiple issuances** — Entities may have multiple capital
  issuances over time
- **Share types** — Different types of shares (common, preferred) with
  different rights and characteristics
- **Temporal tracking** — Tracking capital issuances, changes, and
  redemptions over time
- **Shareholder allocation** — Tracking which shareholders received
  which shares in each issuance
- **Valuation complexity** — Determining the value of issued capital
  at different points in time
- **Regulatory requirements** — Different jurisdictions have different
  requirements for issued capital reporting
- **Relationship context** — Understanding how capital issuances
  affect ownership and control structures
- **Data quality** — Maintaining accurate and complete issued capital
  records
