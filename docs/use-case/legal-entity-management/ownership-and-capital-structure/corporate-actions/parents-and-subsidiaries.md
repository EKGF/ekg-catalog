## Summary

Parent and subsidiary relationship management involves tracking and
managing information about entity parent-subsidiary relationships,
including ownership percentages, control structures, and relationship
types. Understanding parent-subsidiary relationships is essential for
consolidated reporting, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, and
understanding entity structures. These relationships form the
foundation of corporate groups and organizational hierarchies.

## The Challenge

Organizations face challenges in parent-subsidiary relationship
management:

- **Relationship complexity** — Entities may have multiple parents,
  subsidiaries, and complex ownership structures
- **Control determination** — Determining control relationships beyond
  simple ownership percentages
- **Temporal changes** — Parent-subsidiary relationships change
  through M&A, divestitures, and reorganizations
- **Consolidation requirements** — Understanding consolidation
  requirements for financial reporting
- **Regulatory requirements** — Different jurisdictions have different
  requirements for parent-subsidiary disclosure
- **Multi-level hierarchies** — Managing complex multi-level
  parent-subsidiary hierarchies
- **Relationship tracking** — Tracking relationships across entity
  networks and time periods
- **Data quality** — Maintaining accurate and complete
  parent-subsidiary relationship records
