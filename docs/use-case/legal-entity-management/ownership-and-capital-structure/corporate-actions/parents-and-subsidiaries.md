  Parents & Subsidiaries
summary: >-
  Parents and subsidiaries manages parent-subsidiary relationships and hierarchies, determining control relationships beyond simple ownership percentages and tracking how these relationships change through M&A, divestitures, and reorganizations. This use case addresses modeling complex multi-level parent-subsidiary hierarchies, traversing hierarchies to identify all relationships, understanding consolidation requirements for financial reporting, tracking relationship changes over time, meeting regulatory requirements for parent-subsidiary disclosure, and supporting consolidated reporting and risk assessment through comprehensive relationship understanding.

## The Challenge

Organizations face challenges in parent-subsidiary relationship
management:

- **Relationship complexity** — Entities may have multiple parents,
  subsidiaries, and complex ownership structures
- **Control determination** — Determining control relationships beyond
  simple ownership percentages
- **Temporal changes** — Parent-subsidiary relationships change
  through M&A, divestitures, and reorganizations
- **Consolidation requirements** — Understanding consolidation
  requirements for financial reporting
- **Regulatory requirements** — Different jurisdictions have different
  requirements for parent-subsidiary disclosure
- **Multi-level hierarchies** — Managing complex multi-level
  parent-subsidiary hierarchies
- **Relationship tracking** — Tracking relationships across entity
  networks and time periods
- **Data quality** — Maintaining accurate and complete
  parent-subsidiary relationship records
