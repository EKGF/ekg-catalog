# Stock Splits

## Summary

Stock split management involves tracking and managing information about entity stock splits, where entities increase the number of shares outstanding while proportionally reducing share prices. Stock splits affect share ownership, share prices, and capital structure without changing total market capitalization. Understanding stock split history is essential for ownership analysis, share tracking, and historical price analysis.

## The Challenge

Organizations face challenges in stock split management:

- **Ownership adjustment** — Adjusting historical ownership records for stock splits
- **Price adjustment** — Adjusting historical share prices for stock splits
- **Regulatory requirements** — Different jurisdictions have different requirements for stock split reporting
