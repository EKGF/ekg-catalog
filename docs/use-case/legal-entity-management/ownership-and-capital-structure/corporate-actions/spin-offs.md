  Spin-offs
summary: >-
  Spin-offs manages transactions where entities separate business units into independent entities, involving complex asset transfers, liability allocations, and share distributions. This use case addresses modeling complex spin-off transactions with multiple parties, tracking spin-off announcements, approvals, and completions over time, linking spin-offs to asset transfers and liability allocations, understanding how spin-offs affect shareholder distributions and ownership changes, linking spin-offs to regulatory approvals and filings, and reconstructing entity history through spin-off transaction chains for analysis and reporting.

  and filings across jurisdictions
- **Relationship tracking** — Understanding how spin-offs affect
  entity relationships and structures
- **Historical reconstruction** — Reconstructing entity history
  through spin-off transactions
- **Data quality** — Maintaining accurate and complete spin-off
  transaction records
