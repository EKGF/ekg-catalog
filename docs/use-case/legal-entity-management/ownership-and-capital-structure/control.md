  Control
summary: >-
  Control determines who exercises control over entities through multiple mechanisms including ownership, voting rights, board composition, and contractual arrangements, recognizing both formal and de facto control. This use case addresses identifying indirect control through complex ownership chains, analyzing control through multiple mechanisms, tracking control changes over time, identifying ultimate beneficial owners through control structures, meeting regulatory requirements for control disclosure, and supporting risk assessment and corporate governance through comprehensive control analysis.

## The Challenge

Organizations face challenges in control management:

- **Control complexity** — Control can be exercised through multiple
  mechanisms (ownership, voting, board, contracts)
- **Indirect control** — Identifying indirect control through complex
  ownership chains
- **De facto control** — Recognizing de facto control that may not be
  reflected in formal ownership
- **Temporal changes** — Control relationships change over time
  through transactions and reorganizations
- **Regulatory requirements** — Different jurisdictions have different
  definitions and requirements for control
- **Beneficial ownership** — Identifying ultimate beneficial owners
  through complex control structures
- **Relationship tracking** — Understanding control relationships
  across entity networks
- **Compliance monitoring** — Monitoring compliance with
  control-related regulations and requirements

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs provide powerful control management
capabilities:

- **Control modeling** — Model complex control structures and
  mechanisms
- **Chain traversal** — Traverse ownership and control chains to
  identify indirect and beneficial control
- **Multi-mechanism analysis** — Analyze control through ownership,
  voting, board, and contractual mechanisms
- **Temporal tracking** — Track control changes over time and maintain
  historical control records
- **Network analysis** — Understand control relationships across
  entity networks
- **Regulatory integration** — Link control structures to regulatory
  requirements and compliance obligations
- **Beneficial ownership** — Identify ultimate beneficial owners
  through control chain analysis
- **Risk assessment** — Assess control-related risks through
  relationship and network analysis

## Business Value

- **Regulatory compliance** — Meet requirements for control disclosure
  and beneficial ownership identification
- **Risk assessment** — Assess risk based on control structures and
  relationships
- **Corporate governance** — Support corporate governance through
  control structure understanding
- **Due diligence** — Support due diligence through comprehensive
  control analysis
- **Operational efficiency** — Automate control analysis and reduce
  manual tracking
- **Strategic insights** — Understand control structures and
  relationships across entity portfolio
