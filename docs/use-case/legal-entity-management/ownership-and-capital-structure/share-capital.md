# Share Capital

## Summary

Share capital management involves tracking and managing information about entity share capital, including authorized share capital, share classes, par values, and capital structure. Share capital represents the total capital that entities are authorized to issue and is fundamental to entity structure, ownership, and regulatory compliance. Understanding share capital is essential for corporate finance, ownership analysis, and regulatory reporting.
