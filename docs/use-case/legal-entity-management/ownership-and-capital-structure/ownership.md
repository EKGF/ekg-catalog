# Ownership

## Summary

Ownership management involves tracking and managing information about entity ownership, including shareholders, ownership percentages, ownership types, and ownership changes over time. Understanding ownership structures is essential for beneficial ownership identification, risk assessment, corporate governance, and regulatory compliance. Ownership may be direct or indirect through complex ownership chains.

## The Challenge

- **Temporal changes** — Ownership changes over time through transactions, transfers, and corporate actions
- **Beneficial ownership** — Identifying ultimate beneficial owners through ownership chains
- **Ownership types** — Different types of ownership (direct, indirect, beneficial, legal) with different implications
- **Regulatory requirements** — Different jurisdictions have different requirements for ownership disclosure
- **Data quality** — Maintaining accurate and complete ownership records
- **Relationship tracking** — Understanding ownership relationships across entity networks
