<object data="../../../../diagrams/out/compliance.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

## Summary

Compliance management for legal entities involves tracking and
ensuring adherence to regulatory requirements, industry standards, and
internal policies. This includes monitoring compliance status,
managing compliance obligations, tracking regulatory changes, and
maintaining evidence of compliance activities. Effective compliance
management is essential for risk mitigation, regulatory reporting, and
maintaining business licenses.

## The Challenge

Organizations face significant challenges in legal entity compliance
management:

- **Regulatory complexity** — Entities must comply with multiple
  jurisdictions, each with different requirements
- **Dynamic requirements** — Regulations change frequently, requiring
  continuous monitoring and updates
- **Multi-entity management** — Organizations with multiple entities
  must manage compliance across all of them
- **Documentation requirements** — Must maintain comprehensive
  documentation of compliance activities
- **Cross-jurisdictional compliance** — Entities operating in multiple
  jurisdictions face overlapping requirements
- **Compliance tracking** — Tracking compliance status, deadlines, and
  obligations across entities
- **Risk assessment** — Identifying and assessing compliance risks for
  each entity
- **Reporting requirements** — Generating compliance reports for
  regulators and internal stakeholders

Traditional compliance management systems operate in silos and lack
the integrated view needed for comprehensive compliance oversight.
