## The Challenge

Organizations face significant challenges in legal entity document
management:

- **Document volume** — Entities generate and receive large volumes of
  documents across their lifecycle
- **Document diversity** — Documents come in various formats, types,
  and from multiple sources
- **Version control** — Tracking document versions, amendments, and
  updates over time
- **Access control** — Managing document access and ensuring
  appropriate security and confidentiality
- **Retention requirements** — Complying with document retention
  requirements across jurisdictions
- **Document relationships** — Understanding relationships between
  documents, entities, and transactions
- **Search and retrieval** — Finding relevant documents quickly when
  needed
- **Integration** — Connecting documents to entity records,
  transactions, and compliance activities

Traditional document management systems treat documents as isolated
files, missing the rich relationships and context.
