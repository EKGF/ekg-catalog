## Summary

Compliance and Documentation encompasses all compliance activities and
document management for legal entities. This includes tracking
compliance status, managing compliance obligations, maintaining
compliance documentation, and organizing entity-related documents.
Effective compliance and documentation management is essential for
regulatory compliance, risk mitigation, audit support, and operational
efficiency.

## The Challenge

Organizations face significant challenges in compliance and
documentation management:

- **Regulatory complexity** — Entities must comply with multiple
  jurisdictions, each with different requirements
- **Document volume** — Entities generate and receive large volumes of
  documents across their lifecycle
- **Compliance tracking** — Tracking compliance status, deadlines, and
  obligations across entities
- **Document organization** — Organizing and managing documents across
  multiple systems and formats
- **Temporal tracking** — Maintaining historical records of compliance
  activities and document versions
- **Data fragmentation** — Compliance and document information
  scattered across multiple systems
- **Regulatory changes** — Regulations change frequently, requiring
  continuous monitoring and updates
