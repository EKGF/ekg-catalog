## The Challenge

Organizations face significant challenges in compliance and
documentation management:

  multiple systems and formats
- **Temporal tracking** — Maintaining historical records of compliance
  activities and document versions
- **Data fragmentation** — Compliance and document information
  scattered across multiple systems

  continuous monitoring and updates
