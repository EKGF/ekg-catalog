## Summary

Supporting Information encompasses reference data and supporting
details that provide context and enable proper interpretation of legal
entity data. This includes currency information, exchange rates, and
other reference data that supports entity management activities.
Supporting information is essential for accurate financial reporting,
transaction processing, risk management, and regulatory compliance.

## The Challenge

Organizations face significant challenges in supporting information
management:

- **Reference data complexity** — Multiple types of reference data
  with different update frequencies and sources
- **Data quality** — Maintaining accurate and up-to-date reference
  data
- **Temporal tracking** — Tracking reference data changes over time
  (e.g., exchange rates)
- **Multi-source integration** — Integrating reference data from
  multiple sources and systems
- **Regulatory requirements** — Meeting requirements for reference
  data usage and reporting
- **Data consistency** — Ensuring consistent reference data across
  systems and entities
- **Update management** — Managing frequent updates to reference data
  (e.g., daily exchange rates)
