## Summary

Organizational structure management involves modeling and maintaining
the hierarchical structure of legal entities, including reporting
relationships, business units, divisions, and organizational charts.
Understanding organizational structure is essential for corporate
governance, risk management, compliance, and operational
decision-making.

## The Challenge

Organizations face challenges in organizational structure management:

- **Complexity** — Large organizations have complex, multi-level
  structures
- **Dynamic changes** — Organizational structures change through
  reorganizations, mergers, and divestitures
- **Multiple dimensions** — Structures may be defined by legal entity,
  business unit, geography, or function
- **Relationship tracking** — Understanding relationships between
  organizational units and entities
- **Data fragmentation** — Structure information scattered across HR,
  legal, and financial systems
- **Temporal tracking** — Maintaining historical records of
  organizational changes
- **Cross-entity structures** — Understanding structures across entity
  networks and relationships
- **Governance mapping** — Mapping organizational structure to
  governance and decision-making authority
