## Summary

Signatory management involves tracking individuals authorized to sign
on behalf of legal entities, including their signing authority,
limits, and the types of documents they can sign. Signatory
information is critical for transaction authorization, compliance,
fraud prevention, and understanding entity control structures.

## The Challenge

Organizations face challenges in signatory management:

- **Multiple signatories** — Entities may have multiple authorized
  signatories with different authorities
- **Authority limits** — Different signatories may have different
  signing limits and authorities
- **Document types** — Signatories may be authorized for different
  types of documents (contracts, financial, legal)
- **Temporal changes** — Signatory authorities change over time
  through appointments and revocations
- **Delegation** — Understanding delegation chains and temporary
  authorizations
- **Compliance requirements** — Different jurisdictions have different
  requirements for signatory authorization
- **Fraud prevention** — Verifying signatory authority and detecting
  unauthorized signatures
- **Relationship tracking** — Understanding relationships between
  signatories, entities, and transactions

## Why EKG is Required

  entity networks
