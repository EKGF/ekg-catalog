## The Challenge

Organizations face challenges in signatory management:

- **Multiple signatories** — Entities may have multiple authorized
  signatories with different authorities
- **Authority limits** — Different signatories may have different
  signing limits and authorities
- **Document types** — Signatories may be authorized for different
  types of documents (contracts, financial, legal)
- **Temporal changes** — Signatory authorities change over time
  through appointments and revocations
- **Delegation** — Understanding delegation chains and temporary
  authorizations
- **Compliance requirements** — Different jurisdictions have different
  requirements for signatory authorization
- **Fraud prevention** — Verifying signatory authority and detecting
  unauthorized signatures
- **Relationship tracking** — Understanding relationships between
  signatories, entities, and transactions
