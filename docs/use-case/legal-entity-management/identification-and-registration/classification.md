# Classification

## Summary

Entity classification management involves categorizing and classifying legal entities according to various taxonomies, including industry classifications, legal entity types, regulatory classifications, and business classifications. Classification information is used for risk assessment, regulatory compliance, reporting, and entity management.

## The Challenge

Organizations face challenges in entity classification management:

- **Multiple taxonomies** — Entities may be classified using multiple classification systems (NAICS, SIC, GICS)
- **Classification complexity** — Entities may have multiple classifications across different dimensions
- **Temporal changes** — Classifications change as entities evolve and classification systems update
- **Data quality** — Ensuring accurate and consistent classification across systems
- **Regulatory requirements** — Different jurisdictions and regulations require different classifications
- **Relationship context** — Understanding how entity relationships affect classifications
- **Standardization** — Standardizing classifications across entity portfolios
- **Hierarchical structures** — Managing hierarchical classification structures and relationships
