  Classification
summary: >-
  Classification manages entity classifications using multiple taxonomies (NAICS, SIC, GICS) across different dimensions, handling hierarchical classification structures and temporal changes as entities evolve and classification systems update. This use case addresses managing multiple classification systems, standardizing classifications across entity portfolios, linking classifications to regulatory requirements and reporting obligations, tracking classification changes over time, and supporting risk assessment and strategic insights through classification analysis.

## The Challenge

Organizations face challenges in entity classification management:

- **Multiple taxonomies** — Entities may be classified using multiple
  classification systems (NAICS, SIC, GICS)
- **Classification complexity** — Entities may have multiple
  classifications across different dimensions
- **Temporal changes** — Classifications change as entities evolve and
  classification systems update
- **Data quality** — Ensuring accurate and consistent classification
  across systems
- **Regulatory requirements** — Different jurisdictions and
  regulations require different classifications
- **Relationship context** — Understanding how entity relationships
  affect classifications
- **Standardization** — Standardizing classifications across entity
  portfolios
- **Hierarchical structures** — Managing hierarchical classification
  structures and relationships

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs provide powerful classification management
capabilities:

- **Multi-taxonomy integration** — Connect classifications from
  multiple taxonomies and systems
- **Hierarchical modeling** — Model hierarchical classification
  structures and relationships
- **Temporal tracking** — Track classification changes over time and
  maintain historical classifications
- **Relationship analysis** — Understand how entity relationships
  affect classifications
- **Regulatory integration** — Link classifications to regulatory
  requirements and reporting obligations
- **Multi-entity analysis** — Analyze classifications across entity
  portfolios
- **Data quality** — Identify and resolve classification
  inconsistencies through relationship analysis
- **Standardization** — Standardize classifications across entities
  and systems

## Business Value

- **Risk assessment** — Support risk assessment through accurate
  entity classification
- **Regulatory compliance** — Meet requirements for entity
  classification and reporting
- **Reporting efficiency** — Enable efficient reporting through
  standardized classifications
- **Operational efficiency** — Automate classification management and
  reduce manual effort
- **Strategic insights** — Understand entity portfolio composition
  through classification analysis
- **Data quality** — Improve classification data quality through
  validation and standardization
