Organizations face challenges in liability terms management:

  and terms
- **Data fragmentation** — Liability information scattered across
  legal, financial, and treasury systems
- **Relationship context** — Understanding how entity relationships
  affect liability terms and obligations

  disclosure and reporting

  refinancing, covenant breaches)
