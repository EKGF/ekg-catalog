# Ratings

## Summary

Ratings management involves tracking and managing credit ratings, risk ratings, and other entity assessments from rating agencies and internal risk models. Ratings provide standardized assessments of entity creditworthiness, risk, and financial strength, which are used for investment decisions, risk management, and regulatory compliance.

## The Challenge

- **Methodology differences** — Different rating agencies use different methodologies and criteria
- **Data integration** — Integrating ratings from multiple sources and systems
