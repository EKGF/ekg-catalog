## The Challenge

Organizations face challenges in asset management:

- **Asset diversity** — Entities hold various types of assets with
  different characteristics
- **Valuation complexity** — Assets require different valuation
  methods and assumptions
- **Temporal changes** — Asset values and ownership change over time
- **Data fragmentation** — Asset information scattered across
  accounting, legal, and operational systems
- **Depreciation and amortization** — Tracking depreciation,
  amortization, and impairment over time
- **Ownership tracking** — Understanding asset ownership, liens, and
  encumbrances
- **Regulatory requirements** — Different jurisdictions have different
  asset reporting requirements
- **Risk assessment** — Assessing asset-related risks (concentration,
  liquidity, valuation)
