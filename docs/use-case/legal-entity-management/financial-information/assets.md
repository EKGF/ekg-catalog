# Assets

## Summary

Asset management for legal entities involves tracking and managing information about entity assets, including tangible assets (property, equipment), intangible assets (intellectual property, goodwill), and financial assets (investments, cash). Asset information is essential for financial reporting, risk assessment, valuation, and understanding entity financial position.

## The Challenge

Organizations face challenges in asset management:

- **Asset diversity** — Entities hold various types of assets with different characteristics
- **Valuation complexity** — Assets require different valuation methods and assumptions
- **Temporal changes** — Asset values and ownership change over time
- **Data fragmentation** — Asset information scattered across accounting, legal, and operational systems
- **Depreciation and amortization** — Tracking depreciation, amortization, and impairment over time
- **Ownership tracking** — Understanding asset ownership, liens, and encumbrances
- **Regulatory requirements** — Different jurisdictions have different asset reporting requirements
- **Risk assessment** — Assessing asset-related risks (concentration, liquidity, valuation)
