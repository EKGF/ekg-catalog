  Social Graph
summary: >-
  Social graphs model relationships between people across social media platforms to understand who knows whom. This use case addresses platform fragmentation, privacy restrictions, cross-platform identity resolution, distinguishing genuine connections from bot networks, and analyzing network structure to identify influencers, optimize viral marketing, enable customer acquisition through social connections, and detect coordinated inauthentic behavior.

## The Challenge

Organizations attempting to leverage social media face significant
obstacles:

- **Platform fragmentation** — Customers maintain different social
  networks across multiple platforms (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Facebook,
  Instagram, TikTok)
- **Privacy restrictions** — Platform APIs increasingly restrict
  access to social graph data
- **Scale and velocity** — Billions of users creating and changing
  connections in real-time
- **Multiple relationship types** — Friends, followers, subscribers,
  connections each mean different things
- **Bot detection** — Distinguishing genuine social connections from
  automated bot networks
- **Cross-platform identity** — Linking the same person's accounts
  across different platforms
- **Network evolution** — Social connections constantly form and
  dissolve

Traditional analytics tools treat social media as isolated data
sources, missing the interconnected nature of social networks.

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs are ideally suited for social graph
analysis:

- **Native graph structure** — Social networks are literally graphs;
  EKG provides natural representation
- **Multi-platform integration** — Unify social connections across
  LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and proprietary platforms
- **Identity resolution** — Link the same individual across different
  social media accounts
- **Network analysis** — Calculate centrality, influence, community
  structure using graph algorithms
- **Real-time updates** — Continuously update the social graph as new
  connections form
- **Cross-domain linking** — Connect social media identities to
  customer records, transactions, and interactions
- **Privacy-preserving aggregation** — Analyze network patterns while
  respecting individual privacy

## Business Value

- **Influencer identification** — Find customers with large, engaged
  networks for brand advocacy programs
- **Viral marketing** — Understand network structure to optimize
  campaign seeding and information spread
- **Customer acquisition** — Leverage social connections for lookalike
  targeting and referral programs
- **Brand monitoring** — Track how brand mentions and sentiment spread
  through social networks
- **Risk detection** — Identify coordinated inauthentic behavior, bot
  networks, and manipulation campaigns
- **Community insights** — Understand customer communities and
  subcultures for product development
- **Network effects** — Optimize products and features that benefit
  from network effects

## Comparison with Interest Graph

The Social Graph focuses on **who knows whom** — the relationships
between people. The [Interest Graph](interest-graph.md) focuses on
**what people care about** — the relationships between people and
topics, brands, and content. Both are complementary views that
together provide a complete picture of social media dynamics.
