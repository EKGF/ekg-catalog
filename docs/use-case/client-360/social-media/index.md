## The Challenge

Organizations face significant challenges in leveraging social media
data:

- **Platform fragmentation** — Customers maintain different social
  networks across multiple platforms (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Facebook,
  Instagram, TikTok)
- **Privacy restrictions** — Platform APIs increasingly restrict
  access to social graph data
- **Scale and velocity** — Billions of users creating and changing
  connections in real-time
- **Data quality** — Distinguishing genuine social connections from
  automated bot networks
- **Cross-platform identity** — Linking the same person's accounts
  across different platforms
- **Network evolution** — Social connections constantly form and
  dissolve
- **Interest extraction** — Identifying and tracking customer
  interests from social media content
- **Real-time processing** — Processing high-volume, high-velocity
  social media data streams

Traditional analytics tools treat social media as isolated data
sources, missing the interconnected nature of social networks and the
insights that come from graph-based analysis.

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs are ideally suited for social media
analysis:

  LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and proprietary platforms
- **Identity resolution** — Link the same individual across different
  social media accounts
- **Network analysis** — Calculate centrality, influence, community
  structure using graph algorithms
- **Interest modeling** — Model interests as graph relationships
  enabling interest-based recommendations
- **Real-time updates** — Handle high-velocity social media data
  streams
- **Bot detection** — Identify bot networks through graph pattern
  analysis
- **Influence mapping** — Identify influencers and information flow
  through network analysis
