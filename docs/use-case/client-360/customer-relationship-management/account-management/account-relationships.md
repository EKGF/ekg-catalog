## The Challenge

Organizations face significant challenges in account relationship
management:

- **Complex hierarchies** — B2B accounts often have complex
  hierarchies with multiple levels of parent-subsidiary relationships
- **Ownership structures** — Understanding ownership structures and
  control relationships
- **Decision-making units** — Identifying decision-making units within
  account hierarchies
- **Cross-account relationships** — Understanding relationships
  between different accounts (partners, suppliers, customers)
- **Data fragmentation** — Account relationship information scattered
  across CRM, legal entity, and other systems
- **Relationship changes** — Account relationships change over time
  through mergers, acquisitions, and restructuring
- **Multi-system integration** — Integrating account relationship data
  from multiple systems

Traditional account management systems provide limited visibility into
account relationships and lack the integrated view needed for
comprehensive relationship understanding.

  systems for comprehensive relationship understanding
