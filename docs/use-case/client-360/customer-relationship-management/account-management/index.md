## The Challenge

Organizations face significant challenges in account management:

- **Account complexity** — B2B accounts often have complex structures
  with parent companies, subsidiaries, and multiple business units
- **Legal entity understanding** — Need comprehensive understanding of
  legal entity structures, ownership, and relationships
- **Relationship mapping** — Understanding relationships between
  accounts, contacts, and opportunities
- **Account hierarchies** — Managing complex account hierarchies and
  understanding decision-making processes
- **Multi-opportunity management** — Managing multiple opportunities
  within the same account or account hierarchy
- **Account planning** — Developing and executing account growth
  strategies
- **Data fragmentation** — Account information scattered across CRM,
  legal entity, and other systems

Traditional account management systems provide limited visibility into
account structures and lack the integrated view needed for
comprehensive account understanding.
