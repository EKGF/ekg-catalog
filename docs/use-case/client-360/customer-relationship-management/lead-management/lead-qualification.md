## The Challenge

Organizations face significant challenges in lead qualification:

- **Qualification criteria** — Defining and consistently applying
  qualification criteria across teams
- **B2B complexity** — For B2B leads, understanding the legal entity
  structure, decision-making process, and key stakeholders
- **Data availability** — Having sufficient information to make
  qualification decisions
- **Subjectivity** — Qualification can be subjective and inconsistent
  across sales representatives
- **Dynamic criteria** — Qualification criteria may change based on
  market conditions and business priorities
- **Relationship understanding** — Understanding lead relationships
  and connections that may influence qualification
- **Risk assessment** — Assessing lead risk, especially for regulated
  industries

Traditional lead qualification processes rely on manual assessment and
lack the integrated data view needed for comprehensive qualification.

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs provide powerful lead qualification
capabilities:

- **Integrated data view** — Connect lead data with legal entity,
  financial, and relationship information for comprehensive
  qualification
- **Legal entity analysis** — For B2B leads, analyze legal entity
  structures, ownership, and relationships to understand decision
  authority
- **Relationship analysis** — Understand lead relationships and
  connections that may influence qualification
- **Risk assessment** — Integrate with KYC and risk management for
  lead risk assessment
- **Automated scoring** — Use graph relationships and patterns to
  automate lead scoring and qualification
- **Consistency** — Apply qualification criteria consistently across
  all leads using graph queries

## Business Value

- **Improved conversion rates** — Better qualification leads to higher
  conversion rates
- **Sales efficiency** — Sales teams focus on qualified leads with
  higher probability of conversion
- **Reduced sales cycle** — Better qualification reduces time spent on
  unqualified leads
- **Account-based strategies** — For B2B, understanding entity
  structures enables account-based qualification and sales strategies
- **Risk mitigation** — Early risk assessment prevents engagement with
  high-risk leads
