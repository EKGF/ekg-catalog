## The Challenge

Organizations face significant challenges in lead management:

- **Lead volume** — High volumes of leads from multiple sources
  (marketing campaigns, events, referrals, web forms)
- **Lead quality** — Distinguishing qualified leads from unqualified
  ones
- **Lead qualification** — Determining which leads are worth pursuing
  based on fit, need, and budget
- **Data fragmentation** — Lead information scattered across marketing
  automation, CRM, and other systems
- **Lead scoring** — Accurately scoring leads based on multiple
  factors
- **B2B complexity** — For B2B leads, understanding the legal entity
  structure and decision-making process
- **Lead nurturing** — Maintaining engagement with leads over time
- **Attribution** — Understanding which marketing activities generated
  which leads

Traditional lead management systems operate in silos and lack the
integrated view needed for comprehensive lead understanding and
qualification.

- **Attribution modeling** — Track lead sources and marketing
  attribution through graph relationships

- **Cross-system queries** — Query across marketing, CRM, and legal
  entity systems for comprehensive lead understanding

## Business Value

  conversion rates

  leads

  attribution improves marketing effectiveness
