## The Challenge

Organizations face significant challenges in interaction management:

- **Interaction types** — Managing different types of interactions
  (email, phone, meeting, event, social) with different
  characteristics
- **Interaction volume** — High volumes of interactions across many
  customers and accounts
- **Data fragmentation** — Interaction data scattered across email,
  calendar, CRM, social media, and other systems
- **Interaction context** — Understanding interaction context and
  relationships to opportunities and accounts
- **Interaction quality** — Distinguishing meaningful interactions
  from noise
- **Real-time tracking** — Tracking interactions in real-time as they
  occur
- **Interaction analysis** — Analyzing interaction patterns to
  understand engagement and effectiveness

Traditional interaction management systems operate in silos and lack
the integrated view needed for comprehensive interaction
understanding.

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs provide powerful interaction management
capabilities:

- **Unified interaction view** — Connect all interaction information
  across systems and touchpoints
- **Relationship linking** — Link interactions to contacts, accounts,
  and opportunities through graph relationships
- **Context understanding** — Understand interaction context through
  relationships to other entities
- **Multi-touchpoint integration** — Integrate interactions from
  email, calendar, CRM, social media, and other systems
- **Interaction analysis** — Analyze interaction patterns and
  effectiveness using graph queries
- **Engagement scoring** — Use graph relationships to score customer
  engagement based on interactions
- **Real-time updates** — Federated approach enables real-time
  interaction updates from any source

## Business Value

- **Customer engagement visibility** — Clear visibility into customer
  engagement through interactions
- **Sales effectiveness** — Understanding interaction patterns
  improves sales effectiveness
- **Relationship strength** — Measuring interaction frequency and
  quality indicates relationship strength
- **Touchpoint optimization** — Understanding effective interactions
  enables touchpoint optimization
- **Customer experience** — Comprehensive interaction view improves
  customer experience
