## The Challenge

Organizations face significant challenges in activity management:

- **Multi-touchpoint tracking** — Tracking activities across multiple
  channels (email, phone, meetings, events, social media)
- **Activity volume** — Managing high volumes of activities across
  many customers and accounts
- **Data fragmentation** — Activity data scattered across email,
  calendar, CRM, and other systems
- **Activity context** — Understanding activity context and
  relationships to opportunities and accounts
- **Activity attribution** — Attributing activities to opportunities
  and sales outcomes
- **Real-time updates** — Keeping activity data up-to-date in
  real-time
- **Activity analysis** — Analyzing activity patterns to understand
  engagement and effectiveness

Traditional activity management systems operate in silos and lack the
integrated view needed for comprehensive activity understanding.
