## The Challenge

Organizations face significant challenges in CRM:

- **B2B complexity** — Need to know everything about legal entities
  you do business with, including their structures, ownership, and
  relationships
- **B2C complexity** — Need to understand which legal entities private
  customers are affiliated with (employers, board positions,
  investments)
- **Data fragmentation** — Customer and relationship data scattered
  across sales, marketing, service, and other systems
- **Relationship complexity** — Understanding relationships across the
  customer lifecycle from lead to prospect to customer
- **Multi-touchpoint tracking** — Tracking interactions across
  multiple channels and touchpoints
- **Account hierarchies** — Managing complex B2B account structures
  with parent companies, subsidiaries, and decision-making units
- **Contact relationships** — Understanding who the key contacts are
  within accounts and their roles
- **Sales pipeline visibility** — Maintaining accurate pipeline and
  forecasting across teams and territories

Traditional CRM systems operate in silos and lack the integrated view
needed for comprehensive customer relationship understanding,
especially when dealing with complex B2B entity structures.

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs provide powerful CRM capabilities:

- **Unified customer view** — Connect all customer and relationship
  information across systems, channels, and time periods
- **Legal entity integration** — Seamlessly integrate with Legal
  Entity Management for comprehensive B2B account information
- **Relationship understanding** — Graph structure naturally
  represents customer relationships, account hierarchies, and contact
  networks
- **Real-time updates** — Federated approach enables real-time updates
  from any source system
- **Cross-system queries** — Semantic relationships enable queries
  across CRM, legal entity, and other systems without data movement
- **Account hierarchy modeling** — Model complex B2B account
  structures and relationships
- **Contact network analysis** — Understand contact relationships and
  influence within and across accounts
- **Pipeline analytics** — Analyze sales pipeline and forecasting
  across multiple dimensions using graph queries

## Business Value

- **Improved sales effectiveness** — Better understanding of customers
  and accounts enables more effective sales strategies
- **Increased revenue** — Better pipeline management and customer
  understanding leads to increased sales
- **Better customer experience** — Unified view enables personalized
  and consistent customer experiences
- **Reduced sales cycle** — Better qualification and relationship
  understanding reduces time to close
- **Account growth** — Understanding account structures and
  relationships enables account expansion strategies
- **Operational efficiency** — Automated relationship tracking and
  reduced manual data entry

## Related Use Cases

Customer Relationship Management depends on and integrates with
several other use cases:

- **[Legal Entity Management](../../legal-entity-management/index.md)** -
  Essential for B2B account management, CRM uses Legal Entity
  Management to understand corporate customer structures, ownership,
  relationships, and entity hierarchies. This is critical for managing
  complex B2B accounts and understanding which legal entities
  customers are affiliated with in B2C scenarios.

- **[Know Your Customer (KYC)](../know-your-customer/index.md)** - CRM
  uses KYC data for customer onboarding, risk assessment, and
  compliance during the sales process. KYC information helps qualify
  leads and assess customer risk before engagement.

- **[Vendor Management](../../supply-chain-management/vendor-management/index.md)** -
  Vendor relationships share patterns with customer relationships. CRM
  can leverage similar relationship management approaches for managing
  vendor relationships, and understanding vendor networks can inform
  customer relationship strategies.

### Shared Concepts

Customer Relationship Management uses these shared reference data
concepts:

- **[Countries](../../../concept/countries.md)** - Geographic
  reference data for customer and account location
- **[Jurisdictions](../../../concept/jurisdictions.md)** - Legal and
  regulatory jurisdictions for compliance in customer relationships
- **[Regions](../../../concept/regions.md)** - Geographic regions for
  sales territory and account analysis

These shared concepts are also used by Legal Entity Management, Know
Your Customer, and other use cases.
