  Forecasting
summary: >-
  Sales forecasting predicts future revenue by analyzing opportunity pipelines, win probabilities, historical patterns, and account characteristics. This use case enables organizations to generate accurate revenue forecasts across different scenarios (commit, best case, worst case), aggregate forecasts by territory and product, and improve forecast accuracy by incorporating relationship analysis, account insights, and market factors.

## The Challenge

Organizations face significant challenges in sales forecasting:

- **Forecast accuracy** — Accurately predicting revenue based on
  pipeline data
- **Probability assessment** — Determining accurate win probabilities
  for opportunities
- **Multiple forecast types** — Managing different forecast types
  (commit, best case, worst case)
- **Territory aggregation** — Aggregating forecasts across teams and
  territories
- **Market factors** — Accounting for market conditions and external
  factors in forecasts
- **Historical patterns** — Using historical data to improve forecast
  accuracy
- **B2B complexity** — B2B sales cycles are longer and more complex,
  making forecasting more challenging

Traditional forecasting systems rely on simple probability
calculations and lack the integrated view needed for comprehensive
forecasting.

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs provide powerful forecasting capabilities:

- **Integrated data view** — Connect pipeline data with account, legal
  entity, and historical performance data for comprehensive
  forecasting
- **Pattern recognition** — Use graph analysis to identify patterns in
  historical wins/losses and pipeline progression
- **Relationship analysis** — Understand stakeholder relationships and
  influence that may affect forecast accuracy
- **Account analysis** — Analyze account characteristics and
  relationships to improve probability assessment
- **Multi-dimensional forecasting** — Forecast across multiple
  dimensions (territory, product, account type) using graph queries
- **Scenario planning** — Model different forecast scenarios using
  graph relationships
- **Predictive analytics** — Use graph relationships and patterns to
  improve forecast accuracy

## Business Value

- **Improved planning** — More accurate forecasts enable better
  business planning and resource allocation
- **Financial predictability** — Accurate forecasting improves
  financial predictability
- **Risk management** — Understanding forecast scenarios enables risk
  management
- **Resource optimization** — Better forecasting enables optimal
  resource allocation
- **Stakeholder confidence** — Accurate forecasts build stakeholder
  confidence
