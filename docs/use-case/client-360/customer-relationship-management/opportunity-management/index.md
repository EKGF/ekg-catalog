## The Challenge

Organizations face significant challenges in opportunity management:

- **Pipeline visibility** — Maintaining accurate and up-to-date view
  of sales pipeline across teams and territories
- **Forecasting accuracy** — Accurately forecasting revenue based on
  pipeline data
- **Stage management** — Tracking opportunities through sales stages
  and understanding stage progression
- **Multi-opportunity accounts** — Managing multiple opportunities
  within the same account
- **Complex B2B sales** — B2B sales often involve multiple
  stakeholders and decision-making processes across entity hierarchies
- **Data fragmentation** — Opportunity data scattered across CRM,
  sales, and other systems
- **Win/loss analysis** — Understanding why opportunities are won or
  lost

Traditional opportunity management systems provide limited visibility
and lack the integrated view needed for comprehensive opportunity
understanding, especially for complex B2B sales.

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs provide powerful opportunity management
capabilities:

- **Unified opportunity view** — Connect all opportunity information
  across systems and time periods
- **Account integration** — Integrate with account and legal entity
  information for comprehensive opportunity understanding
- **Relationship analysis** — Understand stakeholder relationships and
  influence within opportunities
- **Pipeline analytics** — Analyze pipeline and forecasting across
  multiple dimensions using graph queries
- **Pattern recognition** — Identify patterns in won/lost
  opportunities using graph analysis
- **Multi-opportunity management** — Model and manage multiple
  opportunities within account hierarchies
- **Forecasting accuracy** — Use graph relationships and patterns to
  improve forecasting accuracy

## Business Value

- **Improved forecasting** — More accurate revenue forecasting based
  on comprehensive opportunity data
- **Increased win rates** — Better opportunity management leads to
  higher win rates
- **Sales visibility** — Clear visibility into sales pipeline and
  performance
- **Resource optimization** — Better understanding of opportunities
  enables optimal resource allocation
- **Account growth** — Understanding account structures enables
  opportunity expansion strategies
