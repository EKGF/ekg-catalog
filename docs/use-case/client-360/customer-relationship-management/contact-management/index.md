## The Challenge

Organizations face significant challenges in contact management:

- **Contact volume** — Managing large numbers of contacts across
  multiple accounts
- **Role identification** — Identifying key contacts and their roles
  within accounts
- **Relationship mapping** — Understanding relationships between
  contacts, accounts, and opportunities
- **Contact data quality** — Maintaining accurate and up-to-date
  contact information
- **Multi-account contacts** — Managing contacts that work across
  multiple accounts
- **Decision-making influence** — Understanding which contacts have
  decision-making influence
- **Data fragmentation** — Contact information scattered across CRM,
  email, and other systems

Traditional contact management systems provide limited relationship
visibility and lack the integrated view needed for comprehensive
contact understanding.
