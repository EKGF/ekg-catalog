## The Challenge

Organizations face significant challenges in contact relationship
management:

- **Relationship complexity** — Contacts have complex relationships
  including reporting structures, influence networks, and social
  connections
- **Influence identification** — Identifying which contacts have
  decision-making influence
- **Relationship mapping** — Mapping relationships between contacts,
  accounts, and opportunities
- **Multi-account relationships** — Understanding contacts that work
  across multiple accounts
- **Data fragmentation** — Contact relationship information scattered
  across CRM, email, social media, and other systems
- **Relationship changes** — Contact relationships change over time
  through organizational changes
- **Network analysis** — Understanding contact networks and influence
  patterns

Traditional contact management systems provide limited relationship
visibility and lack the integrated view needed for comprehensive
relationship understanding.
