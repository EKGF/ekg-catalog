  Social connections model relationships between customers revealed through interactions, referrals, social media, and shared activities. This use case addresses discovering unstructured social relationships, managing privacy concerns, distinguishing meaningful relationships from casual connections, detecting fake or fraudulent networks, integrating cross-platform social data, and leveraging social networks for fraud detection, referral optimization, risk assessment, and customer acquisition.

## The Challenge

Organizations need to understand social networks but face obstacles:

- **Unstructured data sources** — Social relationships are revealed
  through interactions, not formal declarations
- **Privacy concerns** — Collecting and using social relationship data
  requires careful privacy management
- **Scale and complexity** — Social networks can be vast and change
  rapidly
- **Fake or fraudulent connections** — Bot networks and fake accounts
  can distort understanding
- **Cross-platform fragmentation** — Social connections exist across
  multiple platforms and channels
- **Weak vs. strong ties** — Distinguishing meaningful relationships
  from casual acquaintances

Traditional CRM systems capture explicit referrals but miss the
broader social context that influences customer behavior.

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs excel at modeling and analyzing social
networks:

- **Graph-native social analysis** — Natural representation of
  "friend-of-friend" relationships and network effects
- **Multi-source integration** — Combine social media data, referral
  patterns, event attendance, and interaction history
- **Community detection** — Automatically identify social clusters and
  communities within customer base
- **Influence measurement** — Calculate social influence scores based
  on network position and connectivity
- **Temporal evolution** — Track how social connections form,
  strengthen, and dissolve over time
- **Privacy-preserving analysis** — Aggregate social patterns while
  protecting individual privacy

## Business Value

- **Fraud detection** — Identify fraud rings through analysis of
  connected accounts and suspicious patterns
- **Referral optimization** — Target highly connected customers for
  referral programs and word-of-mouth marketing
- **Risk assessment** — Understand social risk factors and identify
  customers in distress through their network
- **Customer acquisition** — Leverage social networks for targeted
  marketing and lookalike audience identification
- **Community building** — Foster customer communities and
  peer-to-peer engagement
- **Churn prediction** — Detect churn risk when connected customers
  leave or reduce engagement
