  Business connections model corporate relationships including parent-subsidiary structures, joint ventures, partnerships, supply chains, and beneficial ownership networks. This use case addresses mapping complex corporate structures, tracking evolving relationships through mergers and acquisitions, identifying hidden risks and conflicts of interest, understanding influence networks and decision-making power, and integrating business relationship data across CRM, legal, compliance, and transaction systems.

## The Challenge

Organizations struggle to:

- **Map complex corporate structures** — Identifying parent companies,
  subsidiaries, joint ventures, and beneficial ownership
- **Track evolving relationships** — Business partnerships change
  frequently through mergers, acquisitions, and restructuring
- **Identify hidden risks** — Related party transactions and conflicts
  of interest may not be immediately apparent
- **Cross-reference across systems** — Business relationship data is
  scattered across CRM, legal, compliance, and transaction systems
- **Understand influence networks** — Determining who has actual
  decision-making power vs. nominal authority

Traditional siloed databases make it difficult to see the complete
picture of business relationships and their implications.

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs excel at representing and analyzing
complex business networks:

- **Natural relationship modeling** — Graph structure inherently
  represents business connections and hierarchies
- **Multi-dimensional views** — Simultaneously track ownership,
  partnerships, supply chains, and transactional relationships
- **Temporal tracking** — Maintain historical relationships to
  understand how networks evolve over time
- **Automatic inference** — Discover indirect connections and
  relationships through graph traversal
- **Integrated compliance** — Connect business relationships to
  sanctions screening, AML, and regulatory requirements

## Business Value

- **Enhanced due diligence** — Complete picture of business networks
  reduces risk exposure
- **Opportunity identification** — Discover cross-selling
  opportunities through shared business connections
- **Conflict detection** — Automatically identify potential conflicts
  of interest in transactions
- **Regulatory compliance** — Meet KYC/AML requirements for
  understanding ultimate beneficial ownership
- **Strategic insights** — Understand market positioning and
  competitive dynamics through relationship networks
