## The Challenge

Financial institutions and enterprises face significant challenges:

- **Privacy vs. compliance** — Balancing data privacy regulations
  (GDPR, CCPA) with KYC/AML requirements
- **Hidden relationships** — Family connections are not always
  apparent from transactional data
- **Household dynamics** — Understanding actual household structures
  vs. legal relationships
- **Cross-generational wealth** — Tracking wealth transfer and
  inheritance patterns across generations
- **Risk contagion** — Financial or reputational issues affecting one
  family member can impact others
- **Fragmented data** — Family information scattered across account
  opening forms, beneficiary designations, and customer service notes

Traditional systems store family data as static fields, missing the
dynamic, interconnected nature of family relationships.

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs provide powerful capabilities for modeling
family structures:

- **Complex relationship modeling** — Represent marriages, divorces,
  children, siblings, guardianships, and power of attorney
  relationships
- **Temporal relationships** — Track how family structures change over
  time (marriages, births, deaths)
- **Privacy-preserving linking** — Connect family members while
  maintaining appropriate data access controls
- **Inference capabilities** — Deduce relationships through shared
  addresses, beneficiaries, or joint accounts
- **Multi-generational views** — Visualize family trees and wealth
  transfer patterns across generations
- **Compliance integration** — Connect family relationships to PEP
  screening, sanctions, and risk assessments

## Business Value

- **Enhanced KYC compliance** — Meet regulatory requirements for
  understanding beneficial ownership and control
- **Risk mitigation** — Identify concentration risk when multiple
  family members have significant exposure
- **Wealth management** — Provide holistic family office services and
  estate planning
- **Product recommendations** — Offer family-oriented products
  (education savings, family insurance)
- **Fraud prevention** — Detect suspicious patterns involving related
  parties or identify elder financial abuse
- **Customer experience** — Enable family account management and
  streamlined service for households
