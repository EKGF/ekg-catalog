  Political Connections
summary: >-
  Political connections identify and analyze relationships to politically exposed persons (PEPs) and their family members and close associates to meet regulatory compliance requirements and mitigate corruption and money laundering risks. This use case addresses navigating varying PEP definitions across jurisdictions, identifying indirect connections through family and business relationships, tracking dynamic political positions over time, reducing false positives through contextual analysis, and maintaining continuous monitoring as political positions change.

## The Challenge

Financial institutions and enterprises must navigate complex
requirements:

- **Regulatory mandates** — Global regulations (FATF, FinCEN, EU AML
  directives) require screening for political connections
- **Definition complexity** — What constitutes a PEP varies by
  jurisdiction and changes over time
- **Indirect connections** — Family members and close associates of
  PEPs pose similar risks
- **Dynamic relationships** — Political positions change through
  elections, appointments, and resignations
- **False positives** — Name matching alone creates excessive false
  positives requiring manual review
- **Data quality** — PEP databases have varying quality, coverage, and
  update frequency
- **Cross-border complexity** — Understanding foreign political
  structures and positions

Traditional screening approaches rely on periodic batch checks that
miss real-time changes and indirect connections.

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs provide sophisticated political connection
analysis:

- **Relationship traversal** — Automatically identify connections
  through family, business, or social relationships
- **Multi-hop analysis** — Find indirect connections that may not be
  caught by direct screening
- **Temporal tracking** — Maintain historical political positions and
  understand risk decay over time
- **Contextual risk scoring** — Weight connections based on
  relationship strength, recency, and jurisdiction
- **Continuous monitoring** — Real-time updates as political positions
  change or new connections are discovered
- **Enhanced entity resolution** — Disambiguate individuals with
  similar names using relationship context
- **Integration with other risk factors** — Combine political
  connections with transaction patterns and other red flags

## Business Value

- **Regulatory compliance** — Meet AML/KYC requirements for PEP
  screening and enhanced due diligence
- **Risk mitigation** — Avoid corruption, bribery, and money
  laundering risks associated with political connections
- **Reputational protection** — Prevent association with sanctioned or
  compromised political figures
- **Efficiency gains** — Reduce false positives and manual review
  effort through contextual analysis
- **Proactive monitoring** — Identify emerging risks before they
  become compliance violations
- **Audit trail** — Maintain complete record of political connection
  screening and decisions
