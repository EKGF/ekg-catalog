  Client 360 / Customer 360
summary: >-
  Client 360 (also known as Customer 360) creates a unified, real-time view of customers by integrating data from multiple systems and touchpoints without requiring expensive data warehouses or complex ETL processes. This use case enables organizations to understand customer relationships and connections, provide personalized experiences, and maintain a single source of truth for customer information that automatically updates as new data sources are added through semantic relationships.

## The Challenge

Creating a unified customer view requires:

- Integrating data from multiple systems and touchpoints
- Real-time updates as customer interactions occur
- Connecting customer data across products and services
- Understanding customer relationships and connections
- Providing a single source of truth for customer information
- Enabling personalization and targeted engagement

Traditional approaches require massive data warehouses with complex
ETL processes that are expensive, slow to update, and break when new
data sources are added.

## Why EKG is Required

Traditional approaches require massive data warehouses with complex
ETL processes that are expensive, slow to update, and break when new
data sources are added. EKG enables:

- **Real-time, federated views** — Automatically connect customer data
  from any source through semantic relationships
- **No data duplication** — Federated approach avoids expensive data
  warehouses
- **Rapid integration** — New data sources can be added quickly
  through semantic mapping
- **Relationship understanding** — Graph structure naturally
  represents customer relationships and connections
- **Cross-system queries** — Semantic relationships enable queries
  across all systems without data movement

## Business Value

- **Improved customer experience** — Unified view enables better
  service
- **Reduced churn** — Better understanding enables proactive retention
- **Increased cross-selling** — Complete view enables targeted offers
- **Better personalization** — Comprehensive understanding enables
  personalized experiences
- **Cost reduction** — Federated approach reduces data warehouse costs

## Related Use Cases

Client 360 / Know Your Customer depends on and integrates with several
other use cases:

- **[Legal Entity Management](../legal-entity-management/index.md)** -
  Client 360 uses Legal Entity Management for comprehensive
  information about corporate customers, their legal structures,
  ownership, and relationships. See
  [Legal Entities](../core-record-management/legal-entities.md) for
  details.

### Core Record Management

Client 360 uses
[Core Record Management](../core-record-management/index.md) for
authoritative reference data:

- **[Countries](../core-record-management/countries.md)** - Geographic
  reference data for customer risk assessment
- **[Jurisdictions](../core-record-management/jurisdictions.md)** -
  Legal and regulatory jurisdictions for compliance
- **[Regions](../core-record-management/regions.md)** - Geographic
  regions for risk classification
- **[Addresses](../core-record-management/addresses.md)** - Address
  reference data for identity verification
- **[Legal Entities](../core-record-management/legal-entities.md)** -
  Legal entity reference data for corporate customers

The [Core Record Management](../core-record-management/index.md) use
case is integrated under Know Your Customer, providing the
foundational reference data needed for customer management and KYC
processes.
