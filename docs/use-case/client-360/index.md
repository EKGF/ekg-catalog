# Client 360 / Customer 360

<object data="../../diagrams/out/client-360.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

## Summary

Client 360 (also known as Customer 360) is the arch-use case for
creating a unified, real-time view of every customer across all
touchpoints, products, and interactions.

Every large enterprise struggles with this, often for decades trying to
create one holistic view of their business with their customers, across
lines of business, globally.

This is one of the core use cases where the EKG can shine and can
really add value and is the technology that can actually deliver a
solution for this use case.

## The Challenge

Creating a unified customer view requires:

- Integrating data from multiple systems and touchpoints
- Real-time updates as customer interactions occur
- Connecting customer data across products and services
- Understanding customer relationships and connections
- Providing a single source of truth for customer information
- Enabling personalization and targeted engagement

Traditional approaches require massive data warehouses with complex ETL
processes that are expensive, slow to update, and break when new data
sources are added.

## Why EKG is Required

Traditional approaches require massive data warehouses with complex ETL
processes that are expensive, slow to update, and break when new data
sources are added. EKG enables:

- **Real-time, federated views** — Automatically connect customer data
  from any source through semantic relationships
- **No data duplication** — Federated approach avoids expensive data
  warehouses
- **Rapid integration** — New data sources can be added quickly through
  semantic mapping
- **Relationship understanding** — Graph structure naturally represents
  customer relationships and connections
- **Cross-system queries** — Semantic relationships enable queries
  across all systems without data movement

## Business Value

- **Improved customer experience** — Unified view enables better
  service
- **Reduced churn** — Better understanding enables proactive retention
- **Increased cross-selling** — Complete view enables targeted offers
- **Better personalization** — Comprehensive understanding enables
  personalized experiences
- **Cost reduction** — Federated approach reduces data warehouse costs
