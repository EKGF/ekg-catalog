  Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs)
summary: >-
  PEP screening identifies customers who are politically exposed persons or connected to PEPs through family or business relationships, requiring enhanced due diligence to mitigate corruption and money laundering risks. This use case addresses navigating varying PEP definitions across jurisdictions, identifying indirect connections through relationship traversal, tracking dynamic political positions over time, reducing false positives through contextual analysis, and maintaining continuous monitoring as political positions change.

## The Challenge

Financial institutions face complex challenges in PEP screening:

- **Definition complexity** — PEP definitions vary by jurisdiction and
  regulatory framework (FATF, FinCEN, EU directives)
- **Dynamic status** — Political positions change through elections,
  appointments, and resignations
- **Indirect connections** — Family members and close associates of
  PEPs pose similar risks
- **False positive management** — Name matching alone creates
  excessive false positives requiring manual review
- **Data quality** — PEP databases have varying quality, coverage, and
  update frequency
- **Cross-border complexity** — Understanding foreign political
  structures and positions
- **Risk assessment** — Determining appropriate risk levels and due
  diligence measures for different types of PEPs
- **Continuous monitoring** — PEP status changes require ongoing
  monitoring and re-assessment

Traditional screening approaches rely on periodic batch checks that
miss real-time changes and indirect connections.

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs provide sophisticated PEP screening
capabilities:

- **Relationship traversal** — Automatically identify connections
  through family, business, or social relationships
- **Multi-hop analysis** — Find indirect PEP connections that may not
  be caught by direct screening
- **Temporal tracking** — Maintain historical PEP positions and
  understand risk decay over time
- **Contextual risk scoring** — Weight PEP connections based on
  relationship strength, recency, and jurisdiction
- **Continuous monitoring** — Real-time updates as political positions
  change or new connections are discovered
- **Enhanced entity resolution** — Disambiguate individuals with
  similar names using relationship context
- **Integration with other risk factors** — Combine PEP status with
  transaction patterns and other red flags
- **Compliance documentation** — Maintain complete audit trail of PEP
  screening and risk decisions

## Business Value

- **Regulatory compliance** — Meet AML/KYC requirements for PEP
  screening and enhanced due diligence
- **Risk mitigation** — Avoid corruption, bribery, and money
  laundering risks associated with PEPs
- **Reputational protection** — Prevent association with sanctioned or
  compromised political figures
- **Efficiency gains** — Reduce false positives and manual review
  effort through contextual analysis
- **Proactive monitoring** — Identify emerging PEP risks before they
  become compliance violations
- **Audit trail** — Maintain complete record of PEP screening and
  decisions for regulatory review
