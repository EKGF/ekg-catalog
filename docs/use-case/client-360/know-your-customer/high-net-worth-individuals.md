# High Net Worth Individuals

## Summary

High Net Worth (HNW) individuals require specialized KYC monitoring due to their complex financial profiles, high transaction volumes, and sophisticated wealth management needs. A large number of organizations monitor the transactions of HNW individuals in a separate complementary process along with a more formal annual KYC review. However, traditional monitoring systems struggle to handle the lifestyles of the new rich and produce meaningful warnings or reports that can be used to assess customer behavior.

## The Challenge

Financial institutions face significant challenges in monitoring HNW individuals:

- **Lifestyle complexity** — With top end handbags often costing in excess of £20,000, the alerts holistically triggered run the risk of simply creating noise rather than information
- **Lack of context** — A traditional transaction monitoring platform does not provide any context to customer behavior
- **Behavioral changes** — Has the customer's behaviour profile changed since the last review?
- **Insufficient analysis** — Simply looking at income and outgoings for a customer is not enough—it maybe exactly as the customer has said (say $4MM income $3.8MM expenditure)—so is an alert for a $20,000 handbag what KYC should really be looking for?
- **Multi-dimensional analysis** — What the organization really needs to do is to look at the sources of the income; the countries, investments, companies of familial links
- **Transaction context** — The nature of the expenditure also need to be what has been brought, where and how? The nature of these transactions need to be reviewed holistically, perhaps a customer bought a company in a previous year and then continues funnelling money to this investment
- **Network complexity** — Most large scale money laundering tends to involve networks of individuals and organizations with a controlling force

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs provide powerful capabilities for HNW monitoring:

- **Holistic view** — It is only through using a holistic view that you can get analysis data to give you the context to knowing something different has happened in regard to entities and individuals concerned
- **Counterparty analysis** — A holistic view enables you to connect these counter parties to see if these financial interactions make sense
- **Contextual monitoring** — The ability to monitor activity in context of a holistic view enables the organization to have valuable insights on what these individuals are doing
- **Network identification** — The EKG enables the easier identification of all networks (bank accounts, transactions and customers) which in turn allows for swift analysis of alerts
- **Alert clustering** — A cluster of automatic alerts all in a given network identified by the EKG can be swiftly escalated for review (this is detailed further in the use case on AML)
- **Multi-dimensional analysis** — Connect income sources, countries, investments, companies, and familial links
- **Temporal analysis** — Track how customer behavior and financial patterns evolve over time

This is an important lower level analysis task that knowledge graph excels at because as most large scale money laundering tends to involve networks of individuals and organizations with a controlling force.

## Business Value

- **Enhanced risk assessment** — This information can in turn be used to more effectively assess an individual for AML issues and risk
- **Reduced false positives** — Contextual analysis reduces noise from legitimate high-value transactions
- **Proactive monitoring** — Detect changes in customer behavior and financial patterns early
- **Network insights** — Understand HNW customer networks and relationships for risk assessment
- **Operational efficiency** — Automate alert clustering and prioritization for HNW customers
- **Regulatory compliance** — Meet enhanced due diligence requirements for HNW customers
- **Customer experience** — Minimize disruption to legitimate HNW customers while maintaining security
