  Activity Monitoring
summary: >-
  Activity monitoring continuously tracks customer transactions and behaviors across all channels to detect suspicious patterns and ensure regulatory compliance. This use case addresses processing high volumes of transactions, reducing false positive alerts through contextual analysis, understanding customer behavior in context rather than isolated transactions, detecting evolving risk patterns, providing cross-channel visibility, and enabling proactive risk management through behavioral baselines and network analysis.

## The Challenge

Financial institutions face significant challenges in monitoring
customer activity:

- **Volume and velocity** — Millions of transactions occur daily
  across multiple channels and products
- **False positive overload** — Traditional rule-based systems
  generate excessive alerts requiring manual review
- **Contextual understanding** — Isolated transaction monitoring
  misses the broader context of customer behavior
- **Evolving risk patterns** — Criminals adapt their methods,
  requiring systems that can detect new patterns
- **Cross-channel visibility** — Customer activity spans multiple
  channels (online, mobile, branch, ATM) that are often monitored
  separately
- **Regulatory requirements** — Must demonstrate ongoing monitoring
  and timely detection of suspicious activity
- **Resource constraints** — Limited analyst capacity to review alerts
  effectively

Traditional transaction monitoring systems operate in silos and lack
the holistic view needed to understand customer behavior in context.

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs provide powerful capabilities for activity
monitoring:

- **Holistic customer view** — Connect all customer activities across
  channels, products, and time periods
- **Behavioral baselines** — Establish normal patterns for each
  customer and detect deviations
- **Network analysis** — Identify suspicious activity patterns across
  connected customers and entities
- **Temporal analysis** — Track how customer behavior evolves over
  time and detect gradual changes
- **Contextual alerts** — Reduce false positives by considering
  customer profile, relationships, and historical patterns
- **Real-time processing** — Continuously update the knowledge graph
  as new transactions occur
- **Pattern discovery** — Use graph algorithms to identify new
  suspicious patterns not captured by rules

## Business Value

- **Enhanced risk detection** — Identify suspicious activity more
  accurately with reduced false positives
- **Regulatory compliance** — Meet ongoing monitoring requirements and
  demonstrate effective oversight
- **Operational efficiency** — Reduce manual review effort through
  contextual, intelligent alerting
- **Proactive risk management** — Detect emerging risks before they
  become compliance violations
- **Customer experience** — Minimize disruption to legitimate
  customers while maintaining security
- **Cost reduction** — Optimize resource allocation by focusing on
  genuinely suspicious activity
