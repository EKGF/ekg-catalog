# Activity Monitoring

## Summary

Activity Monitoring tracks and analyzes customer transactions, behaviors, and interactions over time to identify unusual patterns, detect potential financial crime, and ensure ongoing compliance with KYC and AML requirements. Continuous monitoring is essential for maintaining customer relationships and detecting changes in risk profile that may require enhanced due diligence.

## The Challenge

Financial institutions face significant challenges in monitoring customer activity:

- **Volume and velocity** — Millions of transactions occur daily across multiple channels and products
- **False positive overload** — Traditional rule-based systems generate excessive alerts requiring manual review
- **Contextual understanding** — Isolated transaction monitoring misses the broader context of customer behavior
- **Evolving risk patterns** — Criminals adapt their methods, requiring systems that can detect new patterns
- **Cross-channel visibility** — Customer activity spans multiple channels (online, mobile, branch, ATM) that are often monitored separately
- **Regulatory requirements** — Must demonstrate ongoing monitoring and timely detection of suspicious activity
- **Resource constraints** — Limited analyst capacity to review alerts effectively

Traditional transaction monitoring systems operate in silos and lack the holistic view needed to understand customer behavior in context.

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs provide powerful capabilities for activity monitoring:

- **Holistic customer view** — Connect all customer activities across channels, products, and time periods
- **Behavioral baselines** — Establish normal patterns for each customer and detect deviations
- **Network analysis** — Identify suspicious activity patterns across connected customers and entities
- **Temporal analysis** — Track how customer behavior evolves over time and detect gradual changes
- **Contextual alerts** — Reduce false positives by considering customer profile, relationships, and historical patterns
- **Real-time processing** — Continuously update the knowledge graph as new transactions occur
- **Pattern discovery** — Use graph algorithms to identify new suspicious patterns not captured by rules

## Business Value

- **Enhanced risk detection** — Identify suspicious activity more accurately with reduced false positives
- **Regulatory compliance** — Meet ongoing monitoring requirements and demonstrate effective oversight
- **Operational efficiency** — Reduce manual review effort through contextual, intelligent alerting
- **Proactive risk management** — Detect emerging risks before they become compliance violations
- **Customer experience** — Minimize disruption to legitimate customers while maintaining security
- **Cost reduction** — Optimize resource allocation by focusing on genuinely suspicious activity
