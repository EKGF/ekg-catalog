## Summary

Crime Records screening involves checking customers against criminal databases, conviction records, and law enforcement watchlists to identify individuals with criminal histories that may pose risks to the organization. This is a critical component of customer due diligence, helping financial institutions assess risk, comply with regulations, and protect against financial crime.

## The Challenge

Organizations face numerous challenges when screening crime records:

- **Data source fragmentation** — Criminal records exist across multiple jurisdictions, agencies, and databases
- **Privacy and legal restrictions** — Varying laws govern access to and use of criminal record information
- **Name matching complexity** — False positives from common names, aliases, and name variations
- **Data quality issues** — Incomplete, outdated, or inaccurate records in source databases
- **Cross-border complexity** — Criminal records from foreign jurisdictions may be difficult to access or verify
- **Regulatory requirements** — Different jurisdictions have varying requirements for when and how to use criminal records
- **Real-time updates** — Criminal records change as new convictions occur or records are expunged
- **Contextual interpretation** — Understanding the relevance of specific crimes to financial risk

Traditional screening approaches rely on periodic batch checks that may miss recent convictions or fail to provide sufficient context.
