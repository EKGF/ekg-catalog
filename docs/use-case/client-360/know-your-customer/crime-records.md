  Crime Records
summary: >-
  Crime records screening checks customers against criminal databases from multiple jurisdictions to identify individuals with criminal histories that may pose financial or reputational risks. This use case addresses managing fragmented data sources across jurisdictions, reducing false positives through enhanced entity resolution, handling privacy and legal restrictions, interpreting crime relevance to financial risk, and maintaining continuous monitoring as records are updated or expunged.

## The Challenge

Organizations face numerous challenges when screening crime records:

- **Data source fragmentation** — Criminal records exist across
  multiple jurisdictions, agencies, and databases
- **Privacy and legal restrictions** — Varying laws govern access to
  and use of criminal record information
- **Name matching complexity** — False positives from common names,
  aliases, and name variations
- **Data quality issues** — Incomplete, outdated, or inaccurate
  records in source databases
- **Cross-border complexity** — Criminal records from foreign
  jurisdictions may be difficult to access or verify
- **Regulatory requirements** — Different jurisdictions have varying
  requirements for when and how to use criminal records
- **Real-time updates** — Criminal records change as new convictions
  occur or records are expunged
- **Contextual interpretation** — Understanding the relevance of
  specific crimes to financial risk

Traditional screening approaches rely on periodic batch checks that
may miss recent convictions or fail to provide sufficient context.
