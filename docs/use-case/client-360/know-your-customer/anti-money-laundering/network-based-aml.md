# Network Based AML

<object data="../../../../../diagrams/out/network-based-aml.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

## Summary

Network-based AML uses graph analysis and network detection techniques
to identify money laundering patterns across connected customers,
accounts, and transactions. Rather than analyzing individual
transactions in isolation, network-based AML examines the
relationships and connections between entities to detect sophisticated
money laundering schemes that span multiple parties and accounts.

## The Challenge

Financial institutions struggle to detect network-based money
laundering:

- **Complex schemes** — Money laundering often involves networks of
  individuals and organizations working together
- **Fragmented view** — Traditional systems analyze transactions
  individually, missing the network context
- **Hidden connections** — Relationships between parties may not be
  immediately apparent from transaction data
- **Scale and complexity** — Large networks with thousands of nodes
  and connections are difficult to analyze
- **Pattern evolution** — Criminals adapt their methods, requiring
  systems that can detect new network patterns
- **False positive management** — Distinguishing legitimate business
  networks from money laundering networks
- **Regulatory requirements** — Must demonstrate ability to detect
  network-based money laundering

Closely linked with the [KYC use case](../index.md) and further
discussed in the use case
"[High net-worth individuals](../high-net-worth-individuals.md)"
(HNWI), network-based AML requires understanding customer
relationships and networks to identify suspicious patterns.

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs provide powerful network analysis
capabilities:

- **Natural network representation** — Graph structure inherently
  represents relationships and connections
- **Network pattern detection** — Use graph algorithms to identify
  suspicious network structures and patterns
- **Multi-hop analysis** — Traverse networks to find indirect
  connections and relationships
- **Community detection** — Automatically identify clusters and
  communities within customer networks
- **KYC-AML integration** — Knowledge Graph technologies enable
  powerful synergies between AML and KYC to identify patterns and
  networks that may be involved in illegal activity
- **Temporal network analysis** — Track how networks evolve over time
  and detect emerging patterns
- **Holistic view** — Connect all customer relationships,
  transactions, and entities in one unified view

## Business Value

- **Enhanced detection** — Identify sophisticated money laundering
  schemes that span multiple parties
- **Network insights** — Understand the full structure of money
  laundering networks
- **Proactive monitoring** — Detect emerging network patterns before
  they become major issues
- **Regulatory compliance** — Demonstrate ability to detect
  network-based money laundering
- **Operational efficiency** — Automatically identify suspicious
  networks for investigation
- **Risk mitigation** — Prevent money laundering through early
  detection of network patterns

large-scale money laundering tends to involve networks of individuals
and organizations with a controlling force.
