  Network Based AML
summary: >-
  Network-based AML detects money laundering schemes involving multiple interconnected parties by analyzing relationship networks and transaction patterns. This use case addresses identifying hidden connections between parties, detecting complex network structures, understanding how money laundering networks evolve over time, distinguishing legitimate business networks from criminal networks, and leveraging KYC relationship data to identify suspicious patterns across customer networks.

## The Challenge

Financial institutions struggle to detect network-based money
laundering:

- **Complex schemes** — Money laundering often involves networks of
  individuals and organizations working together
- **Fragmented view** — Traditional systems analyze transactions
  individually, missing the network context
- **Hidden connections** — Relationships between parties may not be
  immediately apparent from transaction data
- **Scale and complexity** — Large networks with thousands of nodes
  and connections are difficult to analyze
- **Pattern evolution** — Criminals adapt their methods, requiring
  systems that can detect new network patterns
- **False positive management** — Distinguishing legitimate business
  networks from money laundering networks
- **Regulatory requirements** — Must demonstrate ability to detect
  network-based money laundering

Closely linked with the [KYC use case](../index.md) and further
discussed in the use case
"[High net-worth individuals](../high-net-worth-individuals.md)"
(HNWI), network-based AML requires understanding customer
relationships and networks to identify suspicious patterns.

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs provide powerful network analysis
capabilities:

- **Natural network representation** — Graph structure inherently
  represents relationships and connections
- **Network pattern detection** — Use graph algorithms to identify
  suspicious network structures and patterns
- **Multi-hop analysis** — Traverse networks to find indirect
  connections and relationships
- **Community detection** — Automatically identify clusters and
  communities within customer networks
- **KYC-AML integration** — Knowledge Graph technologies enable
  powerful synergies between AML and KYC to identify patterns and
  networks that may be involved in illegal activity
- **Temporal network analysis** — Track how networks evolve over time
  and detect emerging patterns
- **Holistic view** — Connect all customer relationships,
  transactions, and entities in one unified view

## Business Value

- **Enhanced detection** — Identify sophisticated money laundering
  schemes that span multiple parties
- **Network insights** — Understand the full structure of money
  laundering networks
- **Proactive monitoring** — Detect emerging network patterns before
  they become major issues
- **Regulatory compliance** — Demonstrate ability to detect
  network-based money laundering
- **Operational efficiency** — Automatically identify suspicious
  networks for investigation
- **Risk mitigation** — Prevent money laundering through early
  detection of network patterns

large-scale money laundering tends to involve networks of individuals
and organizations with a controlling force.
