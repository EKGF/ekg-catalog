# Correspondent-based AML

<object data="../../../../../diagrams/out/correspondent-based-aml.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

As a result of fragmented and poor data quality existing AML platforms are
struggling to properly monitor and understand the context of
correspondent banking.
Often this has meant that emphasis has been on the “lower hanging fruit”
of internal clients involved rather than the entire spectrum.
KYC of the foreign party in a correspondent banking transaction is very hard
to achieve leading to large number of false flags of inaccurate mapping
via-vis the organization’s own metadata.
In addition, potential genuine issues are missed as clients are treated
separately as opposed to combining them into one entity.

Knowledge Graph technologies enable a holistic view to be constructed
and can handle these multiple versions of the truth.
This enables the reconstruction of links and networks to analyse historic
and current transactions.
This links into your existing networks to understand the cash flows of
foreign counterparties, nature of the business and context in terms of
ownerships structures.

This allows you the use of all data related to the entity (both internal
and external), to heal or reconstitute the message, completing any
missing data-points for subsequent and historic transactions.
For this point alerts can be raised and suspicious transactions investigated.
