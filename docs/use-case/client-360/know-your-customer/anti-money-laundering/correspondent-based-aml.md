  Correspondent-based AML
summary: >-
  Correspondent-based AML monitors correspondent banking relationships where banks provide services to foreign counterparties, addressing limited visibility into ultimate customers, fragmented transaction data, and difficulty performing KYC on foreign parties. This use case enables holistic views of correspondent networks, reconstructs transaction links, analyzes cash flows and ownership structures, heals incomplete transaction data, and reduces false positives while identifying genuine money laundering risks in correspondent relationships.

## The Challenge

Financial institutions face significant challenges in correspondent
banking AML:

- **Limited visibility** — Banks have limited information about the
  ultimate customers in correspondent transactions
- **Fragmented data** — Transaction data is fragmented across multiple
  systems with poor data quality
- **KYC complexity** — Performing KYC on foreign counterparties is
  difficult, leading to many false positives
- **Multiple versions of truth** — Inconsistent data across systems
  makes it hard to understand transaction context
- **Network complexity** — Correspondent relationships involve complex
  networks of banks, customers, and transactions
- **Regulatory scrutiny** — Correspondent banking is under intense
  regulatory scrutiny for AML compliance
- **Focus limitations** — Traditional systems focus on "lower hanging
  fruit" (internal clients) rather than the full spectrum of risks
- **Missing connections** — Clients are treated separately, missing
  connections that indicate genuine issues

As a result of fragmented and poor data quality, existing AML
platforms struggle to properly monitor and understand the context of
correspondent banking. KYC of the foreign party in a correspondent
banking transaction is very hard to achieve, leading to large numbers
of false flags and inaccurate mapping via-vis the organization's own
metadata. In addition, potential genuine issues are missed as clients
are treated separately as opposed to combining them into one entity.

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs enable a holistic view of correspondent
banking:

- **Holistic view construction** — Knowledge Graph technologies enable
  a holistic view to be constructed and can handle these multiple
  versions of the truth
- **Network reconstruction** — Reconstruct links and networks to
  analyze historic and current transactions
- **Cash flow analysis** — Link into existing networks to understand
  the cash flows of foreign counterparties, nature of the business,
  and context in terms of ownership structures
- **Data healing** — Use all data related to the entity (both internal
  and external) to heal or reconstitute the message, completing any
  missing data-points for subsequent and historic transactions
- **Contextual monitoring** — Understand the full context of
  correspondent relationships and transactions
- **Pattern detection** — Identify suspicious patterns across
  correspondent banking networks

This allows you to use all data related to the entity (both internal
and external) to heal or reconstitute the message, completing any
missing data-points for subsequent and historic transactions. For this
point alerts can be raised and suspicious transactions investigated.

## Business Value

- **Enhanced risk detection** — Identify genuine money laundering
  risks in correspondent banking relationships
- **Reduced false positives** — Better context reduces false flags and
  inaccurate mappings
- **Regulatory compliance** — Meet enhanced due diligence requirements
  for correspondent banking
- **Operational efficiency** — Focus resources on genuine risks rather
  than false positives
- **Network insights** — Understand the full network of correspondent
  relationships and transactions
- **Data quality improvement** — Heal and complete transaction data
  for better analysis
