  Transaction / Finance based AML
summary: >-
  Transaction-based AML focuses on detecting money laundering through trade finance and commercial transactions by analyzing both financial flows and physical goods delivery. This use case addresses the complexity of understanding multi-disciplinary logistics, linking financial transactions with shipping and customs data, detecting sophisticated trade finance laundering schemes, reducing false positives from legitimate trade, and providing an agile platform to develop new detection methods as criminals adapt their techniques.

## The Challenge

Financial institutions face significant challenges in
transaction-based AML:

- **Complexity** — Transaction-based laundering, specifically trade
  finance based laundering, is a difficult problem that enterprises
  have struggled to tackle not least due to its complexity
- **Multi-disciplinary understanding** — Understanding the logistics
  of transactions brings multi-disciplinary challenges in
  understanding let alone delivering the holistic data tools required
  to identify the issues
- **Dual analysis requirement** — Financial flows and the physical
  delivery of the goods must both be analyzed and monitored
- **Regulatory scrutiny** — Whilst only about a fifth of global trade
  is financed, it is an area under great regulatory scrutiny that is
  very difficult to tackle with the existing technical landscape
- **Data fragmentation** — Trade finance data is scattered across
  multiple systems (banking, shipping, customs, etc.)
- **Cross-border complexity** — International trade involves multiple
  jurisdictions with varying regulations
- **Pattern detection** — Criminals adapt their methods, requiring
  systems that can detect new suspicious patterns
- **False positive management** — Distinguishing legitimate trade
  finance from money laundering schemes

However, it is essential to tackle the problem of the illicit
exploitation of the system.

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs provide powerful capabilities for
transaction-based AML:

- **Relationship identification** — The EKG assists this by
  identifying relationships between importers, exporters and other
  related parties
- **Cross-system linking** — Link across to the financial systems to
  link to financed and non-financed trade
- **Holistic views** — These holistic views enable cross silo
  analytics to identify risks
- **Agile platform** — Provide an agile platform to develop new tools
  to identify new potentially illicit behaviours
- **Multi-dimensional analysis** — Connect financial transactions,
  shipping data, customs records, and trade documents
- **Pattern discovery** — Use graph algorithms to identify suspicious
  patterns across trade finance networks
- **Temporal analysis** — Track trade finance transactions over time
  to detect anomalies

## Business Value

- **Enhanced detection** — Identify sophisticated trade finance money
  laundering schemes
- **Regulatory compliance** — Meet enhanced due diligence requirements
  for trade finance
- **Risk mitigation** — Prevent money laundering through trade finance
  channels
- **Operational efficiency** — Automate detection of suspicious trade
  finance patterns
- **Cross-silo insights** — Gain insights by connecting data across
  banking, shipping, and customs systems
- **Agile response** — Quickly develop new detection methods as
  criminals adapt their techniques
