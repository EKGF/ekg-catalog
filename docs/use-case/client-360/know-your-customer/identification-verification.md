  Identification Verification
summary: >-
  Identification verification (IDV) confirms customer identity through document checks, biometric verification, and cross-referencing with other data sources. This use case addresses detecting sophisticated document fraud and synthetic identities, enabling reliable remote onboarding for digital channels, handling diverse global identity documents, balancing security with customer experience, managing biometric data securely, providing real-time verification results, and maintaining audit trails for regulatory compliance.

## The Challenge

Financial institutions face significant challenges in identity
verification:

- **Document fraud** — Sophisticated forgeries and synthetic
  identities are increasingly difficult to detect
- **Remote onboarding** — Digital channels require reliable remote
  identity verification without physical document inspection
- **Global diversity** — Different countries issue different identity
  documents with varying security features
- **Regulatory requirements** — Varying IDV requirements across
  jurisdictions and customer types
- **Customer experience** — Balancing security with a smooth,
  frictionless onboarding experience
- **Biometric integration** — Implementing and managing biometric
  verification across channels
- **Data privacy** — Securely handling sensitive identity documents
  and biometric data
- **Real-time verification** — Need for instant verification results
  during customer onboarding
- **Identity document updates** — Managing re-verification when
  identity documents expire or are renewed

Traditional IDV processes rely on manual document review or simple
automated checks that may miss sophisticated fraud.

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs provide powerful identity verification
capabilities:

- **Unified identity view** — Connect identity documents, biometric
  data, and verification results across channels
- **Identity relationship mapping** — Link identities to detect
  synthetic identities and identity theft
- **Document authenticity tracking** — Maintain records of verified
  documents and detect reuse or tampering
- **Cross-reference validation** — Verify identity by
  cross-referencing with other data sources (addresses, phone numbers,
  etc.)
- **Temporal identity tracking** — Track identity changes over time
  and detect suspicious patterns
- **Risk-based verification** — Apply appropriate verification levels
  based on customer risk profile
- **Fraud pattern detection** — Identify patterns indicating identity
  fraud across multiple customers
- **Compliance documentation** — Maintain complete audit trail of
  identity verification processes

## Business Value

- **Fraud prevention** — Detect and prevent identity fraud and
  synthetic identity creation
- **Regulatory compliance** — Meet KYC requirements for identity
  verification and documentation
- **Customer experience** — Enable fast, seamless identity
  verification across digital channels
- **Risk reduction** — Reduce exposure to identity-related fraud and
  financial crime
- **Operational efficiency** — Automate identity verification and
  reduce manual review
- **Cost savings** — Reduce fraud losses and compliance penalties
  through effective IDV
