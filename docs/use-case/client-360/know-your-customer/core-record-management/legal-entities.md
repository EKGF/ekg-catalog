# Legal Entities

## Summary

Legal entity management in KYC involves maintaining comprehensive information about corporate customers, their legal structures, ownership, and relationships. Legal entities include corporations, partnerships, trusts, and other business structures. Understanding legal entities is essential for beneficial ownership identification, risk assessment, and regulatory compliance.

## The Challenge

Financial institutions face challenges in legal entity management:

- **Complex structures** — Legal entities may have complex ownership structures with multiple layers
- **Beneficial ownership** — Identifying ultimate beneficial owners through complex ownership chains
- **Entity relationships** — Understanding relationships between legal entities (parent, subsidiary, joint venture)
- **Data fragmentation** — Entity information scattered across multiple systems and data sources
- **Regulatory requirements** — Must identify and verify beneficial owners for AML compliance
- **Dynamic changes** — Entity structures change through mergers, acquisitions, and restructuring
- **Cross-border complexity** — Entities may operate across multiple jurisdictions with different legal frameworks
- **Data quality** — Maintaining accurate and up-to-date entity information
