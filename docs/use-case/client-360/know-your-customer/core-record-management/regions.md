  Region reference data in the Client 360/KYC context provides geographic risk classification at a higher level than countries, supporting risk assessment and sanctions compliance. This use case addresses managing regions defined in multiple ways (geographic, economic, political, regulatory), maintaining region risk ratings, understanding relationships between regions and countries, tracking dynamic region risk levels, and enabling region-based risk assessment and screening for customers with multi-regional operations.

## The Challenge

Financial institutions face challenges in region management:

- **Definition complexity** — Regions can be defined in multiple ways
  (geographic, economic, political, regulatory)
- **Risk classification** — Determining and maintaining region risk
  ratings
- **Relationship mapping** — Understanding relationships between
  regions, countries, and jurisdictions
- **Dynamic changes** — Region risk levels and definitions change over
  time
- **Customer assignment** — Determining which regions apply to
  customers with multi-regional operations
- **Data consistency** — Ensuring consistent region data across
  systems
- **Sanctions implications** — Tracking which regions are subject to
  sanctions or embargoes
- **Regulatory requirements** — Understanding region-specific
  regulatory requirements

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs provide powerful region management
capabilities:

- **Hierarchical modeling** — Model relationships between regions,
  countries, and jurisdictions
- **Risk classification** — Connect regions to risk ratings and
  compliance requirements
- **Temporal tracking** — Track changes in region risk levels and
  definitions over time
- **Customer linking** — Connect customers to regions for geographic
  risk assessment
- **Sanctions integration** — Link regions to sanctions regimes and
  embargoes
- **Multi-dimensional analysis** — Analyze customer risk based on
  regional relationships
- **Reference data management** — Maintain authoritative region
  reference data with relationships

## Business Value

- **Risk assessment** — Assess geographic risk based on customer
  regional relationships
- **Regulatory compliance** — Meet requirements for region-based risk
  assessment
- **Sanctions compliance** — Identify customers in sanctioned regions
  for enhanced screening
- **Data quality** — Maintain consistent and accurate region reference
  data
- **Operational efficiency** — Automate region-based risk assessment
  and screening
- **Strategic insights** — Understand regional distribution of
  customer base and risks
