# Regions

## Summary

Region management in KYC involves maintaining information about geographic regions, their risk classifications, and relationships to countries and jurisdictions. Regions may be defined by geography, economics, politics, or regulatory frameworks. Understanding regions is important for risk assessment, sanctions screening, and geographic analysis.
