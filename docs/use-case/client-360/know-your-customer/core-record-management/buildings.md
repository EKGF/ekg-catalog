# Buildings

## Summary

Building management in KYC involves tracking and managing information
about physical buildings and properties associated with customers,
including business locations, registered addresses, and property
ownership. This information is used for risk assessment, address
validation, and understanding customer business operations.

## The Challenge

Financial institutions face challenges in building management:

- **Data collection** — Gathering accurate information about buildings
  and properties
- **Property relationships** — Understanding ownership, tenancy, and
  business relationships to properties
- **Geographic context** — Connecting buildings to addresses,
  jurisdictions, and regions
- **Risk assessment** — Using building information for geographic and
  business risk assessment
- **Data quality** — Maintaining accurate and up-to-date building
  information
- **Multiple relationships** — Customers may have multiple building
  relationships (owner, tenant, business location)
- **Change tracking** — Tracking changes in building ownership,
  occupancy, and use over time
- **Integration** — Connecting building data with address, location,
  and customer records
