## The Challenge

Financial institutions face challenges in country management:

- **Risk classification** — Determining and maintaining country risk
  ratings for AML and sanctions purposes
- **Regulatory requirements** — Understanding different regulatory
  requirements for customers from different countries
- **Dynamic risk** — Country risk levels change over time based on
  political, economic, and security factors
- **Data consistency** — Ensuring consistent country data across
  systems and processes
- **Geographic relationships** — Understanding relationships between
  countries, regions, and jurisdictions
- **Sanctions implications** — Tracking which countries are subject to
  sanctions or embargoes
- **PEP identification** — Understanding political structures in
  different countries for PEP screening
- **Data quality** — Maintaining accurate country reference data and
  handling country name variations
