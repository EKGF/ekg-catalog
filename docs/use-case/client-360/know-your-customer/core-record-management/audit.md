# Audit

## Summary

Audit management in KYC involves maintaining complete records of all
customer due diligence activities, decisions, and changes to support
regulatory compliance, internal reviews, and external examinations.
Comprehensive audit trails are essential for demonstrating that
appropriate KYC processes were followed and for investigating issues
when they arise.

## The Challenge

Financial institutions face challenges in audit management:

- **Record completeness** — Ensuring all KYC activities, decisions,
  and changes are properly documented
- **Data fragmentation** — Audit information scattered across multiple
  systems and processes

  customer profiles and risk assessments changed over time
- **Regulatory requirements** — Must demonstrate compliance with audit
  and record-keeping requirements
- **Investigation support** — Need to quickly retrieve and analyze
  audit records when issues are identified
- **Data retention** — Managing long-term retention of audit records
  in compliance with regulations
- **Access control** — Ensuring appropriate access controls for
  sensitive audit information
- **Integration complexity** — Connecting audit records across
  different systems and processes
