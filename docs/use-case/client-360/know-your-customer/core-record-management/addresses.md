# Addresses

## Summary

Address management is a fundamental component of KYC core record management, involving the collection, validation, and maintenance of customer addresses for identity verification, risk assessment, and regulatory compliance. Addresses serve as critical identifying information and are used for sanctions screening, PEP identification, and understanding customer geographic risk.

## The Challenge

Financial institutions face challenges in address management:

- **Address format diversity** — Different countries use different address formats and conventions
- **Data quality** — Addresses may be incomplete, inaccurate, or use inconsistent formatting
- **Address changes** — Customers move frequently, requiring ongoing address validation and updates
- **Multiple addresses** — Customers may have residential, business, mailing, and registered addresses
- **Geographic risk** — Addresses in high-risk jurisdictions require enhanced due diligence
- **Validation complexity** — Verifying address authenticity across different countries and jurisdictions
- **Privacy regulations** — Managing address data in compliance with GDPR and other privacy regulations
- **Data integration** — Address data is scattered across multiple systems and must be unified
