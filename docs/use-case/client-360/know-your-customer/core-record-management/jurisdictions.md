# Jurisdictions

## Summary

Jurisdiction management in KYC involves maintaining information about
legal and regulatory jurisdictions, their requirements, and risk
classifications. Jurisdictions may be countries, states, provinces, or
other legal entities that have distinct regulatory frameworks.
Understanding jurisdictions is critical for compliance, risk
assessment, and determining appropriate due diligence measures.

## The Challenge

Financial institutions face challenges in jurisdiction management:

- **Complexity** — Jurisdictions can be countries, states, provinces,
  or other legal entities with overlapping boundaries
- **Regulatory requirements** — Different jurisdictions have different
  KYC, AML, and data privacy requirements
- **Risk classification** — Determining and maintaining jurisdiction
  risk ratings
- **Dynamic changes** — Jurisdictional requirements and risk levels
  change over time
- **Relationship mapping** — Understanding relationships between
  jurisdictions, countries, and regions
- **Customer assignment** — Determining which jurisdictions apply to
  customers with multi-jurisdictional operations
- **Data consistency** — Ensuring consistent jurisdiction data across
  systems
- **Compliance complexity** — Managing compliance with multiple
  overlapping jurisdictions
