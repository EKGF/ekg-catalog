## The Challenge

Financial institutions face challenges in jurisdiction management:

- **Complexity** — Jurisdictions can be countries, states, provinces,
  or other legal entities with overlapping boundaries
- **Regulatory requirements** — Different jurisdictions have different
  KYC, AML, and data privacy requirements
- **Risk classification** — Determining and maintaining jurisdiction
  risk ratings
- **Dynamic changes** — Jurisdictional requirements and risk levels
  change over time
- **Relationship mapping** — Understanding relationships between
  jurisdictions, countries, and regions
- **Customer assignment** — Determining which jurisdictions apply to
  customers with multi-jurisdictional operations
- **Data consistency** — Ensuring consistent jurisdiction data across
  systems
- **Compliance complexity** — Managing compliance with multiple
  overlapping jurisdictions

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs provide powerful jurisdiction management
capabilities:

- **Hierarchical modeling** — Model relationships between
  jurisdictions, countries, and regions
- **Regulatory mapping** — Connect jurisdictions to specific
  regulatory requirements and frameworks
- **Risk classification** — Link jurisdictions to risk ratings and
  compliance requirements
- **Temporal tracking** — Track changes in jurisdictional requirements
  and risk levels over time
- **Customer linking** — Connect customers to jurisdictions for
  compliance and risk assessment
- **Multi-jurisdictional analysis** — Analyze customers operating
  across multiple jurisdictions
- **Compliance automation** — Automate jurisdiction-based compliance
  and risk assessment

## Business Value

- **Regulatory compliance** — Meet jurisdiction-specific regulatory
  requirements
- **Risk assessment** — Assess risk based on customer jurisdictional
  relationships
- **Due diligence** — Determine appropriate due diligence measures
  based on jurisdiction
- **Data quality** — Maintain consistent and accurate jurisdiction
  reference data
- **Operational efficiency** — Automate jurisdiction-based compliance
  processes
- **Strategic insights** — Understand jurisdictional distribution of
  customer base and risks
