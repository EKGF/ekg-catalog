# Locations

## Summary

Location management in KYC involves maintaining information about
geographic locations associated with customers, including business
locations, operational sites, and service delivery points. Locations
provide geographic context for risk assessment, regulatory compliance,
and understanding customer operations.

## The Challenge

Financial institutions face challenges in location management:

- **Location diversity** — Customers may have multiple locations
  (headquarters, branches, operational sites)
- **Geographic context** — Understanding locations in context of
  addresses, buildings, jurisdictions, and regions
- **Risk assessment** — Using location information for geographic risk
  assessment
- **Data quality** — Maintaining accurate location data with proper
  coordinates and addresses
- **Relationship mapping** — Understanding relationships between
  locations, customers, and business operations
- **Change tracking** — Tracking changes in customer locations over
  time
- **Integration** — Connecting location data with address, building,
  and customer records
- **Standardization** — Standardizing location data formats across
  different sources
