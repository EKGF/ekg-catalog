  GDPR
summary: >-
  GDPR compliance ensures organizations meet European data protection requirements including data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure, portability), consent management, data minimization, and the right to be forgotten. This use case addresses managing fragmented customer data across systems, tracking complete data lifecycles from lead to customer, integrating data from all touchpoints and systems, maintaining audit trails, and enabling data discovery while respecting privacy rights and maintaining necessary compliance records.

## The Challenge

Financial institutions face significant challenges in GDPR compliance:

- **Data fragmentation** — Customer data is scattered across multiple
  systems, making it difficult to track and manage
- **Data subject rights** — Must be able to respond to requests for
  data access, rectification, erasure, and portability
- **Consent management** — Tracking and managing customer consent for
  data processing across different purposes
- **Data minimization** — Ensuring only necessary data is collected
  and processed
- **Right to be forgotten** — Ability to delete customer data when
  requested, while maintaining necessary records for compliance
- **Data lifecycle tracking** — Tracking and tracing all activities
  and all facts around the end-to-end life cycle of a customer,
  starting as a lead or prospect
- **Cross-system integration** — Tying not only CRM systems to the EKG
  but also all their transactions, emails, documents, phone calls,
  time registration, contracts, invoices, budgets, costs, projects,
  SLAs, issues, tickets, market data, competitive analysis, interest
  graphs, pattern detection, ML and AI
- **Audit requirements** — Must demonstrate compliance with GDPR
  requirements and data processing activities

Traditional siloed systems make it difficult to maintain a
comprehensive view of customer data while ensuring GDPR compliance.

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs provide powerful GDPR compliance
capabilities:

- **Holistic data view** — By creating a holistic view of the data
  within the organization, all customer data can be managed in one
  logical (but not physical) place
- **Data subject management** — Track all data related to a customer
  across systems and processes
- **Consent tracking** — Maintain complete records of customer consent
  and data processing purposes
- **Data discovery** — Allows for "discovery" of anything around a
  customer, enabling colleagues to learn about the customer and gain
  understanding or even knowledge, overseeing it all, seeing the
  customer and all their subsidiaries and global operations as one
  whole with infinite drill down capability
- **AI-ready knowledge** — That knowledge can not only be provided to
  humans but also to AIs
- **Data minimization** — Identify and manage only necessary data for
  each processing purpose
- **Right to be forgotten** — Identify all instances of customer data
  across systems for deletion when requested
- **Compliance documentation** — Maintain complete audit trail of data
  processing activities

## Business Value

- **Regulatory compliance** — It would make any organization compliant
  with GDPR for instance
- **Customer trust** — Demonstrate commitment to data protection and
  privacy
- **Operational efficiency** — Centralized data management reduces
  complexity and improves data quality
- **Risk mitigation** — Avoid GDPR fines and penalties through
  effective compliance
- **Data quality** — Improved data quality through unified data
  management
- **Customer insights** — Better understanding of customers through
  holistic data view
- **Competitive advantage** — GDPR compliance as a differentiator in
  the market
