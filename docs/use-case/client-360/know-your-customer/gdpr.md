### GDPR

By creating a holistic view of the data within the organization and
leveraging both internally and externally available data (such as
directors, shareholders, sanctions and adverse lists) the EKG can create
a holistic view and analyse current and potential clients.
This enables the identification of direct and indirect (i.e. beneficial
ownership structures) risk factors.

- Tracking and tracing all activities and all facts around the end to end
  life cycle of a customer, starting as a lead or prospect and bringing
  that all together in one logical (but not physical) place would provide
  tremendous value in many different ways.
- It would make any organization compliant with GDPR for instance.
  (Btw GDPR compliance might be worth a chapter in itself or should be
  in the title of this use case).
- Tying not only CRM systems to the EKG but also all their transactions,
  again logically, not physically, all emails, documents, phone calls,
  time registration, contracts, invoices, budgets, costs, projects,
  SLAs, issues, tickets, market data, competitive analysis,
  interest graphs, pattern detection, ML and AI and so forth.
- Last but not least: it allows for “discovery” of anything around a
  customer, enabling your colleagues to learn about the customer and
  gain understanding or even knowledge, overseeing it all,
  seeing the customer and all their subsidiaries and global operations
  for instance as one whole with infinite drill down capability.
  And that knowledge can not only be provided to humans but also to
  AIs by the way.
