  Sanctions
summary: >-
  Sanctions screening checks customers and transactions against multiple sanctions lists from different jurisdictions (OFAC, EU, UN, UK) to prevent prohibited activity and avoid severe regulatory penalties. This use case addresses managing frequent list updates, reducing false positives from name matching through enhanced entity resolution, identifying indirect connections to sanctioned entities, providing real-time screening for transactions, and maintaining complete audit trails of screening decisions.

## The Challenge

Financial institutions face significant challenges in sanctions
screening:

- **Multiple sanctions regimes** — Must comply with OFAC (US), EU, UN,
  UK, and other jurisdictions' sanctions
- **Frequent list updates** — Sanctions lists change daily as new
  individuals and entities are added or removed
- **Name matching complexity** — False positives from common names,
  transliterations, and name variations
- **Entity resolution** — Determining if a customer matches a
  sanctioned entity requires sophisticated matching
- **Indirect connections** — Must screen not just direct customers but
  also beneficial owners and related parties
- **Real-time requirements** — Transactions must be screened in
  real-time to prevent prohibited activity
- **Regulatory penalties** — Severe fines and criminal penalties for
  sanctions violations
- **Data quality** — Sanctions lists may have incomplete or
  inconsistent data

Traditional screening approaches rely on periodic batch checks that
may miss recent additions or fail to provide sufficient context for
accurate matching.

## Why EKG is Required

Enterprise Knowledge Graphs provide powerful sanctions screening
capabilities:

- **Multi-list integration** — Connect sanctions lists from multiple
  jurisdictions and maintain unified view
- **Enhanced entity resolution** — Use relationship context to
  disambiguate individuals and entities with similar names
- **Relationship analysis** — Identify indirect connections to
  sanctioned entities through business or family relationships
- **Temporal tracking** — Maintain historical sanctions data and track
  changes as lists are updated
- **Real-time screening** — Continuously screen customers and
  transactions as sanctions lists are updated
- **Contextual matching** — Reduce false positives by considering
  additional identifying information (dates of birth, addresses, etc.)
- **Network analysis** — Identify entire networks connected to
  sanctioned entities
- **Compliance documentation** — Maintain complete audit trail of
  sanctions screening and decisions

## Business Value

- **Regulatory compliance** — Meet mandatory sanctions screening
  requirements and avoid severe penalties
- **Risk mitigation** — Prevent prohibited transactions and avoid
  association with sanctioned entities
- **Reputational protection** — Avoid damage from sanctions violations
  and negative media attention
- **Operational efficiency** — Reduce false positives and manual
  review effort through intelligent matching
- **Real-time protection** — Screen transactions in real-time to
  prevent sanctions violations
- **Cost reduction** — Avoid fines and penalties that can reach
  billions of dollars
