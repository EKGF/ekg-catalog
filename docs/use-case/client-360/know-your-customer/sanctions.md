# Sanctions

<object data="../../../../diagrams/out/sanctions.svg#darkable" type="image/svg+xml"></object>

## Summary

Sanctions screening involves checking customers, transactions, and business relationships against government sanctions lists and embargoes to ensure compliance with international sanctions regimes. It is a critical component of KYC and AML compliance, helping financial institutions avoid severe penalties and reputational damage from prohibited transactions.

## The Challenge

Financial institutions face significant challenges in sanctions screening:

- **Multiple sanctions regimes** — Must comply with OFAC (US), EU, UN, UK, and other jurisdictions' sanctions
- **Frequent list updates** — Sanctions lists change daily as new individuals and entities are added or removed
- **Name matching complexity** — False positives from common names, transliterations, and name variations
- **Entity resolution** — Determining if a customer matches a sanctioned entity requires sophisticated matching
- **Indirect connections** — Must screen not just direct customers but also beneficial owners and related parties
- **Real-time requirements** — Transactions must be screened in real-time to prevent prohibited activity
- **Regulatory penalties** — Severe fines and criminal penalties for sanctions violations
- **Data quality** — Sanctions lists may have incomplete or inconsistent data

Traditional screening approaches rely on periodic batch checks that may miss recent additions or fail to provide sufficient context for accurate matching.
