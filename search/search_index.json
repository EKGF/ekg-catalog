Indeed, it is estimated that financial institutions in the US spent  roughly $25 billion on AML annually. Traditional databases are not flexible enough to tackle these complex  data structures that are always in flux. These siloed databases store data in separate tables and columns,  requiring complex code and business/technical knowledge to join up  relationships and understand meaning.

Take for example the Panama Papers.</p> <p>The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)  had more than 200 journalists in 64 countries working on cross-border  investigations. This required the processing of 2.6 terabytes of data and mining  11.5 million files.
