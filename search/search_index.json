help identify a money laundering transaction is an immense and expensive task.

Traditional databases are not flexible enough to tackle these complex data structures that are always in flux. These siloed databases store data in separate tables and columns, requiring complex code and business/technical knowledge to join up relationships and understand meaning. A graph database, however, stores the data as \u201cnodes\u201d or relationships, which can be easily linked without specific knowledge of the often very limited and inflexible underlying database schemas.</p> <p>Graph technologies are powerful enough to join the dots and identify discrepancies.
