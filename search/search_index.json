This is an important lower level analysis task that knowledge graph excels at because as most large scale money laundering tends to involve networks of individuals and organizations with a controlling force.

Indeed, it is estimated that financial institutions in the US spent  roughly $25 billion on AML annually. Traditional databases are not flexible enough to tackle these complex  data structures that are always in flux. These siloed databases store data in separate tables and columns,  requiring complex code and business/technical knowledge to join up  relationships and understand meaning.
