Simply looking at income and outgoings for a customer is not enough it maybe exactly as the customer has said (say $4MM income $3.8MM expenditure) \u2014 so is an alert for a $20,000 handbag what KYC should really be looking for?</p> <p>What the organization really needs to do is to look at the sources of the income; the countries, investments, companies of familial links.

It is only through using a holistic view that you can get analysis data to give you the context to knowing something different has happened in regard to entities and individuals concerned.</p> <p>A holistic view enables you to connect these counter parties to see if these financial interactions make sense. The ability to monitor activity in context of a holistic view enables the organization to have valuable insights on what these individuals are doing. This information can in turn be used to more effectively assess an individual for AML issues and risk. This is an important lower level analysis task that knowledge graph excels at because as most large scale money laundering tends to involve networks of individuals and organizations with a controlling force. The EKG enables the easier identification of all networks (bank accounts, transactions and customers) which in turn allows for swift analysis of alerts.

Indeed, it is estimated that financial institutions in the US spent  roughly $25 billion on AML annually. Traditional databases are not flexible enough to tackle these complex  data structures that are always in flux. These siloed databases store data in separate tables and columns,  requiring complex code and business/technical knowledge to join up  relationships and understand meaning. A graph database, however, stores the data as \u201cnodes\u201d or relationships,  which can be easily linked without specific knowledge of the often  very limited and inflexible underlying database schemas.</p> <p>Graph technologies are powerful enough to join the dots and identify  discrepancies. Take for example the Panama Papers.</p> <p>The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)  had more than 200 journalists in 64 countries working on cross-border  investigations. This required the processing of 2.6 terabytes of data and mining  11.5 million files. The ICIJ used graph technology to uncover the connections because  it was able to make the link between relationships. These, journalists did not have to be data scientists or experts  on the databases to work with a graph representation of a dataset. They could simply click their way through the data while following  connections.</p> <p>That is an example of an independent use case of the EKG. Most financial organizations have been monitoring AML in the same way  many years. Typically, organizations struggle with very high levels of false  alerts and reports to the regulator, in spite of recent scandals,  have remained stubbornly low.</p> <p>Clearly a new approach is needed if organizations are going to  tackle financial crime and terrorism.</p>","title":"Anti Money Laundering (AML)"},{"location":"use-case/client-360/know-your-customer/anti-money-laundering/correspondent-based-aml/","text":"<p>As a result of fragmented and poor data quality existing AML platforms are struggling to properly monitor and understand the context of correspondent banking.
