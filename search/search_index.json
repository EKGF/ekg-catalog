This information can in turn be used to more effectively assess an individual for AML issues and risk. This is an important lower level analysis task that knowledge graph excels at because as most large scale money laundering tends to involve networks of individuals and organizations with a controlling force.

Indeed, it is estimated that financial institutions in the US spent  roughly $25 billion on AML annually. Traditional databases are not flexible enough to tackle these complex  data structures that are always in flux. These siloed databases store data in separate tables and columns,  requiring complex code and business/technical knowledge to join up  relationships and understand meaning.

These, journalists did not have to be data scientists or experts  on the databases to work with a graph representation of a dataset. They could simply click their way through the data while following  connections.</p> <p>That is an example of an independent use case of the EKG.
